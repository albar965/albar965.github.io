changelog=
  <p>This release fixes several errors and adds two new export functions
  for the <a href="http://www.reality-xp.com">Reality XP</a> <em>GNS 530W/430W V2</em> and <em>GTN 750/650 Touch</em>.</p>
  <p>The changelog below contains links to the relevant parts of the manual if applicable.</p>
  <p>The program will automatically show a question dialog and then copy and prepare the included Navigraph database on first
  start if the included cycle 1707 is still used. The included database received minor updates.</p>
  <p><strong>For Linux users:</strong> The startup shell scripts have been deleted since they are not needed anymore. The program
  can be started directly from any folder.</p>
  <p><strong>►► Please reload the scenery databases to avoid problems with saved flight plans. ◄◄</strong></p>
  <h3 id="included-progams">Included Progams</h3>
  <p><em>Little Xpconnect</em> was updated to 1.0.6. See included <code>CHANGELOG.txt</code> for a list of changes.</p>
  <p><em>Little Navconnect</em> was updated to 1.8.3. See included <code>CHANGELOG.txt</code>.</p>
  <h3 id="changes-from-release-183-to-184">Changes from Release 1.8.3 to 1.8.4</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Added flight plan export for <em>Reality XP</em> GTN and GNS units in the <code>Export Flight Plan to other Formats</code> menu.
  See here in the manual:
  <a href="https://albar965.gitbooks.io/little-navmap-user-manual/content/v/release/1.8/en/FLIGHTPLANFMT.html#flight-plan-formats-rxpgns">FPL (Reality XP Garmin GNS)</a>,
  <a href="https://albar965.gitbooks.io/little-navmap-user-manual/content/v/release/1.8/en/FLIGHTPLANFMT.html#flight-plan-formats-rxpgtn">GFP (Reality XP Garmin GTN)</a> and
  <a href="https://albar965.gitbooks.io/little-navmap-user-manual/content/v/release/1.8/en/MENUS.html#export-submenu">Export Sub-Menu</a>.</li>
  <li>Added option to save Garmin flight plans with user defined waypoints to avoid
  locked waypoints on AIRAC cycle mismatch. See dialog <code>Options</code> on tab <code>Flight Plan</code> and here in the online manual:
  <a href="https://albar965.gitbooks.io/little-navmap-user-manual/content/v/release/1.8/en/FLIGHTPLANFMT.html#garmin-notes">Notes about the Garmin Formats GFP and FPL</a>.</li>
  <li>Added <strong>X-Plane 3D airport attribute</strong> in the airport search window in the dropdown list <code>All Ratings</code>.
  Also shown in airport facilities list in tooltips and information window.</li>
  <li>Now displaying runway names for SIDs and STARs with reference to multiple parallel or all runways in procedure search.
  Needs scenery database reload.</li>
  <li><strong>macOS compatibility changed</strong> since program crashes on 10.9 and below.
  <strong>Now at least version 10.10 is needed</strong>. Program now refuses to run on Mavericks or older and shows an error dialog.
  This had to be done due to requirements in used programming libraries.</li>
  <li>Added setting in dialog <code>Options</code> on tab <code>Map</code> to <strong>disable tooltips</strong> for selected map features: airports, navaids or airspaces.</li>
  <li>Changed route description text field to mono-spaced font and changed wrapping for better readability.</li>
  <li>Added warning dialog when AIRAC cycle is not available when saving flight plans in X-Plane FMS 11 format.</li>
  <li>Helipads can now be selected as a start position from the map context menu.</li>
  <li>Small adjustment to taxiway labels to show more often.</li>
  <li>Added display for airport regions where available.</li>
  <li>Updated French translation, French manual and legend.</li>
  <li>Updated database to allow future fixes of issue <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/179">179</a>.</li>
  <li>Database minor version changed to 8 to indicate updated schema. Reloading the scenery databases is recommended.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="fixed-errors">Fixed Errors</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Fixed Majestic Dash FPR flight plan export.</strong></li>
  <li>Departure runway is now correctly assigned according to SID runway when loading from formats
  which do not support departure parking (e.g. FMS or FPL).</li>
  <li>Made flight plan format detection more tolerant for X-Plane FMS 11 files with missing cycle information.</li>
  <li>Fixed issues where X-Plane cannot load STAR in FMS 11 flight plans because runway reference is missing.</li>
  <li>Now using correct AIRAC cycle from nav database when writing
  X-Plane FMS 11 files. Used simulator database version previously which
  could result in X-Plane warnings and unusable flight plans.</li>
  <li>Fixed issue where helipad was not loaded correctly from FSX PLN files in certain cases.</li>
  <li>Fixed Linux build to avoid problems with shared libraries on some platforms for all programs.</li>
  <li>Removed unneeded startup scripts for Linux. Program executable can now be started directly from any folder without
  setting library path.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem where French translation was loaded if OS has French as second or third language.</li>
  <li>Solved problem where translation files were loaded mixed in some cases.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem with initial wrong folder selection if default does not exist when saving or exporting flight plans.</li>
  <li>Fixed <code>No Simulator found ...</code> warning dialog for Linux and macOS which should show up only on Windows first startup.</li>
  <li>Made program more tolerant for older database files and improved compatibility.</li>
  <li>Number of approach lighting systems is now correctly assigned to airports in loaded X-Plane scenery data.
  This issue resulted in many airports having an ALS indication where none is.</li>
  </ul>

  </ul>
  <p><b>Old Changes</b></p>

        used automatically on startup.</li>
      <li>Added sub-menu for third party navdata in menu
        <code>Scenery Library</code> with three display options.</li>
      <li>Changed main window title bar to indicate usage of navdata (i.e. Navigraph):<br/>
        <code>FSX/N</code>: simulator and navdata,
        <code>(FSX)/N</code>: navdata only and
        <code>FSX</code>: simulator only.</li>
      <li>Program can now display mixed data (i.e. <code>FSX/N</code>)
        on map and in information window:<br/>
        Complete airports and ILS from simulator data. Navaids, airways, airspaces and procedures
        from third party navdata like Navigraph.</li>
      <li>Additonal third party database is now opened from application directory
        first and can be overloaded in settings database directory by a newer one. Programm checks

        format is not usable by X-Plane 11.05.<br/>
        FMS 11 is now the default format when saving FMS although it needs at least a 11.10 beta version.<br/>
        FMS 3 can still be saved using the export option.</li>
      <li>Adapted airspace and COM display to new types. Added caution airspace.</li>
      <li>Removed SIDs and STARs in information dock window on procedure tab since this information was not useful.</li>

      <li>Fixed several display issues with large airspaces and airways crossing the anti meridian. These showed up
        mirrored with their tooltips in other parts of the world. Small problems remain (e.g. Melbourne FIR).</li>
      <li>FSX/P3D: Added workaround for scenery sort order with add-on.xml files missing layer id.
