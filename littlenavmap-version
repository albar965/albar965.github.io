  </ul>
  <h3>Map</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Now falling back to magnetic heading for aircraft rotation on map if true heading is not available.
    This should solve wrong aircraft heading on some online network clients where all client aircraft were shown
    with a heading of zero degree.</li>
  <li>Added X-Plane 3D airport flag as additional criteria for treating empty airports. This can
    be used to hide or dim all X-Plane airports which are not 3D. See <code>Options</code> on tab <code>Map</code>.</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Search</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Added override mode for airport ICAO search. All other search options will be ignored if a
    user enters more than two characters in the <code>ICAO Code</code> field. Override is indicated in
    the bottom label below the search result table. This helps to quickly find an airport without
    resetting search options.</li>
  <li>Added follow selection mode to context menus of all search windows.
    Will center selected navaid, airport or procedures on the map using the current zoomlevel when
    enabled. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/129">#129</a></li>
  <li>Increased maximum search radius for airports to 8000 nm.</li>
  </ul>

    <code>All</code> or <code>23L/23R</code>. Added sub menu in procedure search for SID/STAR selection
    if more than one runway can be selected. Procedures are now correctly resolved if loading or
    assigning such cases. This solves problems when saving procedures in X-Plane FMC 11 format or other
    various formats. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/179">#179</a></li>
  <li>Changed context menu <code>Show Procedures</code> to show different texts when airport is
    destination or departure of current flight plan. Show procedures now sets filter to departure or
    arrival procedures depending on selected airport of flight plan.</li>
  <li>Now showing a red warning message on top of the flight plan window if STAR and approach
    runways do not match. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/179">#179</a></li>
  <li>Fixed tooltip and information display showing facility <code>Procedures</code> for all airports.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem where fixes for long (&gt; 200 NM) SID or STAR procedures could not be resolved

  <li>Fixes for missing airway segments in DFD compiler. Fixed duplicate removal of
    waypoints. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/201">#201</a></li>
  <li>Now ignoring artificial circle-to-land approaches in DFD compiler.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>X-Plane and Navigraph</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>SID and STAR common routes are now merged correctly into
    procedures. This results in correct SID/STAR and also removes
    the <code>ghost</code> entries. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/193">#193</a></li>
  <li>Now removing all unneeded dummy NDB and VOR waypoints that were
    created for airway generation. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/201">#201</a></li>

    of the base directory which is allowed in P3D. These were silently omitted previously.</li>
  <li>Reading <code>.../Roaming/.../add-on.cfg</code> and
    <code>.../ProgramData/.../add-on.cfg</code> now. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/211">#211</a></li>
  <li>FSX/P3D is now hidden in the scenery library menu if the simulator base folder from the registry does not exist. This should help to avoid menu items for uninstalled simulators.</li>
  <li>Added script by Gérard to clean out fake runways for AI in FSX/P3D.</li>
  <li>Added logging for airport altitude to log file when reading delete records from FSX/P3D.
    Example: <code>Add-on airport altitude for VQ10 changed from 7703 ft (BGL Scenery/0902/APX72220.bgl) to 8363 ft</code></li>
  <li>Improved BGL file and scenery reading to include hidden and system files.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>X-Plane</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>Updated included magnetic declination file to 2018.</li>
  <li>Fixed issue with X-Plane airports that have a far off reference position. Now
    falling back to center of bounding rectangle or center of a single runway.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem where CIFP files with lower case names were not recognized correctly.</li>
  <li>Fixed issues with file or directory exclusion for X-Plane scenery loader
    which did not work properly in some cases.</li>
  <li><code>Custom Scenery/Global Airports/Earth nav data/earth_nav.dat</code> is
    now read properly to get fixed ILS. This solves problems wrong ILS heading in many places like LOWI.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Customization</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Program will create a backup of <code>little_navmap_mapstyle.ini</code> and replace file with new colors
    (blue airways). All customization files are now versioned. Section <code>[Options]</code>.</li>
  <li>Added <code>customize</code> folder and icons.zip for icon templates to allow users creating their own icons
    based on default ones.</li>
  </ul>
