  <ul>
  <li>Added flight plan export for <em>Reality XP</em> GTN and GNS units in the <code>Export Flight Plan to other Formats</code> menu.
  See here in the manual:
  <a href="https://albar965.gitbooks.io/little-navmap-user-manual/content/v/release/1.8/en/FLIGHTPLANFMT.html#flight-plan-formats-rxpgns">FPL (Reality XP Garmin GNS)</a>,

  <a href="https://albar965.gitbooks.io/little-navmap-user-manual/content/v/release/1.8/en/MENUS.html#export-submenu">Export Sub-Menu</a>.</li>
  <li>Added option to save Garmin flight plans with user defined waypoints to avoid
  locked waypoints on AIRAC cycle mismatch. See dialog <code>Options</code> on tab <code>Flight Plan</code> and here in the online manual:
  <a href="https://albar965.gitbooks.io/little-navmap-user-manual/content/v/release/1.8/en/FLIGHTPLANFMT.html#garmin-notes">Notes about the Garmin Formats GFP and FPL</a>.</li>

  This had to be done due to requirements in used programming libraries.</li>
  <li>Added setting in dialog <code>Options</code> on tab <code>Map</code> to <strong>disable tooltips</strong> for selected map features: airports, navaids or airspaces.</li>
  <li>Changed route description text field to mono-spaced font and changed wrapping for better readability.</li>
  <li>Added warning dialog when AIRAC cycle is not available when saving flight plans in X-Plane FMS 11 format.</li>
  <li>Helipads can now be selected as a start position from the map context menu.</li>

  <li>Database minor version changed to 8 to indicate updated schema. Reloading the scenery databases is recommended.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="fixed-errors">Fixed Errors</h4>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Fixed Majestic Dash FPR flight plan export.</strong></li>
  <li>Departure runway is now correctly assigned according to SID runway when loading from formats
  which do not support departure parking (e.g. FMS or FPL).</li>
  <li>Made flight plan format detection more tolerant for X-Plane FMS 11 files with missing cycle information.</li>
  <li>Fixed issues where X-Plane cannot load STAR in FMS 11 flight plans because runway reference is missing.</li>
  <li>Now using correct AIRAC cycle from nav database when writing
  X-Plane FMS 11 files. Used simulator database version previously which
  could result in X-Plane warnings and unusable flight plans.</li>
  <li>Fixed issue where helipad was not loaded correctly from FSX PLN files in certain cases.</li>
  <li>Fixed Linux build to avoid problems with shared libraries on some platforms for all programs.</li>
  <li>Removed unneeded startup scripts for Linux. Program executable can now be started directly from any folder without
  setting library path.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem where French translation was loaded if OS has French as second or third language.</li>
  <li>Solved problem where translation files were loaded mixed in some cases.</li>
  <li>Fixed problem with initial wrong folder selection if default does not exist when saving or exporting flight plans.</li>
  <li>Fixed <code>No Simulator found ...</code> warning dialog for Linux and macOS which should show up only on Windows first startup.</li>
  <li>Made program more tolerant for older database files and improved compatibility.</li>
  <li>Number of approach lighting systems is now correctly assigned to airports in loaded X-Plane scenery data.
  This issue resulted in many airports having an ALS indication where none is.</li>

    <li>Added display of magnetic declination below cursor to status bar.</li>
    <li>Added override mode for airport ICAO search. All other search options will be ignored if a
        user enters more than two characters in the &quot;ICAO Code&quot; field. Override is indicated in
        the bottom label below the search result table. This helps to quickly find an airport without
        resetting search options.</li>
    <li>Changed context menu &quot;Show Procedures&quot; to show different texts when airport is
        destination or departure of current flight plan. Show procedures now sets filter to departure or
        arrival procedures depending on selected airport of flight plan.</li>
    <li>Added follow selection mode to context menus of the flight plan and all search windows.
        Will center selected navaid, airport or procedures on the map using the current zoomlevel when
        enabled. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/129">#129</a></li>
    <li>Changes for SID and STAR that use multiple or parallel runway assignments indicated by e.g.
        &quot;All&quot; or &quot;23L/23R&quot;. Added sub menu in procedure search for SID/STAR selection
        if more than one runway can be selected. Procedures are now correctly resolved if loading or
        assigning such cases. This solves problems when saving procedures in X-Plane FMC 11 format or other
        various formats. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/179">#179</a></li>
    <li>Now showing a red warning message on top of the flight plan window if STAR and approach
        runways do not match. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/179">#179</a></li>
    <li>Increased maximum search radius for airports to 8000.</li>
    <li>Fixed problem where fixes for long (> 200 NM) SID or STAR procedures could not be resolved
        and showed red waypoint errors in the procedure search tree.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where airway information was not reloaded in information display after
        startup.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- ====================================== -->
  <b>General</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixes to translatable texts. About dialog &quot;Contact:&quot; and other texts are now
        translated.</li>
    <li>Translated windows titles in menu &quot;Window&quot; are now correct and not lower
        case.</li>
    <li>Now all export menu items are disabled if not flight plan is loaded.</li>
    <li>Extended version comparison for update checking release candidates where 1.1.1.rc2 is
        smaller than stable 1.1.1 for example.</li>
  </ul>
  <!-- ====================================== -->
  <b>Scenery Database</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Updated magnetic declination file to 2018.</li>
    <li>FSX/P3D only: Now reading FSX/P3D scenery entries pointing to &quot;scenery&quot; instead
        of the base directory which is allowed in P3D. These were silently omitted previously.</li>
    <li>FSX/P3D only: Reading &quot;.../Roaming/.../add-on.cfg&quot; and
        &quot;.../ProgramData/.../add-on.cfg&quot; now. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/211">#211</a></li>
    <li>X-Plane only: Fixed problem where CIFP files with lower case names were not recognized
        correctly.</li>
    <li>X-Plane only: Fixed approach lighting system indication for airports in X-Plane
        compiler.</li>
    <li>X-Plane only: Fixed issue with X-Plane airports that have wrong reference position. Now
        falling back to center of bounding rectangle or center of a single runway.</li>
    <li>X-Plane only: Fixed issues with file or directory exclusion for X-Plane scenery loader
        which did not work properly in some cases.</li>
    <li>X-Plane only: &quot;Custom Scenery/Global Airports/Earth nav data/earth_nav.dat&quot; is
        now read to get fixed ILS. This fixes wrong ILS heading in many places like LOWI.</li>
    <li>Navigraph only: Added transition altitude to airport.</li>
    <li>Navigraph only: Now updating magnetic declination for VOR, DME or TACAN with calculated
        value where missing.</li>
    <li>Navigraph only: Corrected wrong runway heading for Navigraph compilation. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/214">#214</a></li>
    <li>X-Plane and Navigraph only: SID and STAR common routes are now merged correctly into
        procedures for Navigraph and X-Plane compiler. This results in correct SID/STAR and also removes
        the &quot;ghost&quot; entries. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/193">#193</a></li>
    <li>X-Plane and Navigraph only: Now removing all unneeded dummy NDB and VOR waypoints that were
        created for airway generation. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/201">#201</a></li>
    <li>Fixes for missing airway segments in DFD compiler. Fixed duplicate removal of
        waypoints. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/201">#201</a></li>
