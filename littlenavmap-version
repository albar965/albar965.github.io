      New Options
    </b>
    <p>
      Tooltips in dialog <code>Options</code> give more help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that some options were moved around in the options dialog. These are also marked in the images.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added scrolling and zooming ability to elevation profile. Elevation profile now has a context menu also
      including <code>Show on Map</code> and more functions.
        <br />
        Added splitter to elevation profile dock window which has sliders for zooming vertically and horizontally.
        These can be hidden by dragging the splitter to the right.
        <br />
        Zooming can also be done using mouse wheel (<code>Wheel+Shift</code> for vertical zooming).
        <br />
        Added keyboard navigation using cursor keys and numpad keys for zooming and scrolling.
        <br />
        Panning in elevation profile with mouse click and moving like in map. Double click zooms to position on map.
        <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a>
      </li>
      <li>Elevation profile now uses same aircraft icon as map. Changed elevation profile to completely adhere to map
      painting settings like line width, text size and symbol size. Profile display now hides flight plan if hidden on
      map. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/298">#298</a>
      </li>
      <li>Adjusted elevation profile to display passed, active, straight-in and circle-to-land flight plan legs in the
      same colors like the flight plan on the map. Navaid symbols are now on the descending or ascending line.
        <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/298">#298</a>
      </li>
      <li>Added option to display ILS and VASI slopes in elevation profile if an approach is selected. Menu items allow
      to disable these. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/299">#299</a>
      </li>
      <li>Added calculation and display for top of climb to elevation profile display. Calculation based on aircraft
      performance data.
      </li>
      <li>Now showing procedure altitude restrictions in profile display.
      </li>
      <li>Top of descent is calculated considering altitude restrictions of approach or STAR. Same for top of climb and
      SID. All legs after and at the FAF and FACF points are forced to minimum altitude to avoid arriving above ILS
      glideslope.
      </li>
      <li>Display of <code>Above Ground Altitude</code> on top label in profile window follows climb and descent slope
      instead of using cruise altitude.
      </li>
      <li>Giving clear error indication if cruise altitude is too high (i.e. TOC and TOC overlap) or if restrictions
      are violated due to too low cruise altitude.
      </li>
      <li>Removed barely visible highlight on map when hovering cursor above elevation profile. Highlight colors can
      now be customized in <code>little_navmap_mapstyle.ini</code>. Mouse position in elevation profile is now shown
      with a cyan/black circle on the map. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a>
      </li>
      <li>Jump back to aircraft functionality added in elevation profile. Uses the same settings as the map. <a href=
      "https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed display color of profile labels for night mode. Removed all dark profile colors and pens from
      <code>little_navmap_mapstyle.ini</code>. Using OS and style colors now. <a href=
      "https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a>
      </li>
      <li>Solved problems where aircraft in elevation profile jumped to wrong leg or moved backwards.
      </li>
      <li>Aircraft track is now ignored when determining profile window altitude to avoid confusion when stale tracks
      result in wrong profile maximum.
      </li>
      <li>Aircraft direction now turned if reversal relative to active leg detected.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed issue where short lines were given wrong elevation with GLOBE data resulting in gaps in the elevation
      profile ground.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed several issues with aircraft movement and trail in elevation profile. Profile trail now depends on
      active leg and is now saved separately from aircraft trail on map.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <li>Fixed several problems for aircraft and next waypoint centering mode. Updates are now triggered by a timer
      depending on speed and distance to waypoint. Minimum zoom distance is now a function of altitude above ground.
        <br />
        See dialog <code>Options</code> on tab <code>Simulator Aircraft</code>: <code>Allow scrolling ...</code> and
        <code>Jump back ...</code>.
      </li>
      <li>Centering of active flight plan leg and aircraft (if enabled in options) falls back to simple aircraft
      centering if distance to flight plan is larger than 50 NM.
        <br />
        This helps to avoid situations where the program zoomed too far out when flying with stale flight plans.
      </li>
      <li>Changed jump-back-to-aircraft logic to avoid weird behavior (zooming far out and other issues).
        <br />
        <strong>When aircraft is on ground or <code>Center map on aircraft and next flight plan waypoint</code> is not
        selected:</strong>

      </li>
      <li>Start looking around on the map by moving first (mouse drag or cursor keys) and not by zooming (mouse wheel
      or plus and minus keys) to suppress aircraft centering for a while.
      </li>
      <li>Zooming without movement (drag or cursor keys only) keeps the zoom distance.
      </li>
      <li>Added option to avoid blurred online maps. This is enabled per default. See dialog <code>Options</code> on
      tab <code>Map</code>: <code>Avoid blurred ...</code>. This options works best with the map projection

      <li>ILS labels now adhere to the text background color setting for navaids. This allows to select a white
      background for the labels for better visibility.
      </li>
      <li>Now omitting curves, arcs, holds, procedure turns and other fancy geometry of procedures on high zoom factors
      to avoid a mess up of graphics in the spherical projection. Fixed flight plan leg distance label turning into
      weird directions when using spherical projection and at high zoom factors. <a href=

  <li>Added links to well known directory <code>Documents/Little Navmap Files/ICAO</code> for airport information. Links to all included files are shown if the path exists for an airport with the given ICAO ident. The path is locale sensitive, e.g. in German <code>Dokumente/Little Navmap Dateien/ICAO</code>.
