  <p><b>Changes from 1.8.1.beta to 1.8.2.beta</b></p>
    <p>Reloading the scenery databases is recommended.<br/>The program will ask to overwrite the Navigraph database since I updated it.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fixed crashes and freezes with invalid or incomplete procedures. 
      Drawing code is now more robust for invalid procedure legs.</li>
    <li>Updated English manual and French program translation.</li>
    <li>Fixed problem where invalid procedure legs were not recognized (course/heading to DME distance or VOR radial).</li>
    <li>Holding time in procedure legs in Navigraph database corrected. 
      Now determining unit (time or distance) instead of using time for all.</li>
    <li>Fixed problem in Navigraph database where compiler did not set fix or 
      recommended fix in legs resulting in invalid procedures.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Old Changes</b></p>
  <small>
  <p><b>Changes from 1.8.0.beta to 1.8.1.beta</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Added cycle information to X-Plane menu item in scenery library menu.</li>
    <li>Scenery library menu item is now disabled instead of being hidden if only one simulator is installed.</li>
    <li>Fixed problem where no scenery database was selected on first startup causing crashes when loading a flight plan.</li>
    <li>Now asking before overwriting navdata database if included navdata update is newer than the current one.</li>
    <li>Fixed handling of missing or inaccessible legend file. Now silently ignores error and redirects to
        web page if unavailable.</li>
    <li>Fixed error in scenery library menu where a menu item could be deselected resulting in no selection at all.</li>
    <li>Updated links to online manual to point to updated 1.8 version.</li>
    <li>Changed the building of help URLs and file paths to use the language override setting in the options dialog.
      Help links point to English help now if GUI is forced to English.</li>
    <li>Updated included English PDF manual.</li>
    <li>Updated French translations and added translated offline manual PDF by Patrick.</li>
  </ul>
    <p>Changes from 1.6.7 to 1.8.0.beta</p>
    <p>Improvements</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added Navigraph database cycle 1707 to program download archive. Database is prepared and
        used automatically on startup.</li>
      <li>Added sub-menu for third party navdata in menu
        <code>Scenery Library</code> with three display options.</li>
      <li>Changed main window title bar to indicate usage of navdata (i.e. Navigraph):<br/>
        <code>FSX/N</code>: simulator and navdata,
        <code>(FSX)/N</code>: navdata only and
        <code>FSX</code>: simulator only.</li>
      <li>Program can now display mixed data (i.e. <code>FSX/N</code>)
        on map and in information window:<br/>
        Complete airports and ILS from simulator data. Navaids, airways, airspaces and procedures
        from third party navdata like Navigraph.</li>
      <li>Additonal third party database is now opened from application directory
        first and can be overloaded in settings database directory by a newer one. Programm checks
        database internal compilation time before copying and creates database indexes on demand.
        Database is copied and prepared on first startup.</li>
      <li>Added French legend and updates to translation by Patrick.</li>
      <li>Updated Linux startup script so that it can be used also by the desktop launcher (thanks to Valerio for the tip).</li>
      <li>Now adding all readme and changelog files to macOS deployment.</li>
      <li>Added command line option <code>-s</code> or
        <code>--settings-directory</code> that allows to change the
        <code>ABarthel</code> part of the
        settings directory for testing purposes like running more than one version of Little Navmap.</li>
      <li>Added settings in option dialog on tab <code>User Interface</code>
        to force language and locale (number format, date format and more) in program to English.</li>
      <li>Added options to disable restoring the last search parameters, information window content and
        aircraft trail on startup in options dialog on tab <code>Startup</code>.</li>
      <li>Added flight plan export for Majestic Dash. Currently limited to waypoints.</li>
      <li>Added export for IXEG 737 flight plan format.</li>
      <li>Flight plan export to Flight Factor Airbus added.</li>
      <li>Enabled saving of the new X-Plane 11 FMS file format and added warning before saving since the
        format is not usable by X-Plane 11.05.<br/>
        FMS 11 is now the default format when saving FMS although it needs at least a 11.10 beta version.<br/>
        FMS 3 can still be saved using the export option.</li>
      <li>Adapted airspace and COM display to new types. Added caution airspace.</li>
      <li>Removed SIDs and STARs in information dock window on procedure tab since this information was not useful.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fixed Errors</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed error where ARINC name of procedures was not loaded causing problems when exporting and loading flight plans.</li>
      <li>Information dock window on tab <code>Runways/Helipads</code>
        can now display more than one ILS for a runway end (EDDF 25R/07L).</li>
      <li>Fixed problem in ATS route string parser where an airway as an invalid first entry did not generate a warning message.</li>
      <li>Fixed error in route string parser which did not recognize STARs correctly.</li>
      <li>Fixed error where first enroute waypoint contained an airway reference after calculating with SID in some cases.
        This caused problems when exporting some flight plan formats and in the route string parser.</li>
      <li>Fixed several display issues with large airspaces and airways crossing the anti meridian. These showed up
        mirrored with their tooltips in other parts of the world. Small problems remain (e.g. Melbourne FIR).</li>
      <li>FSX/P3D: Added workaround for scenery sort order with add-on.xml files missing layer id.
        Now forcing navaid updates to end of all scenery entries.</li>
      <li>Fixed error where an automatic connect was attempted even when hostname is empty.</li>
      <li>Fixed problem with almost invisible checkbox in night mode.</li>
      <li>Fixed error with wrong ILS pitch in X-Plane compiler.</li>
      <li>Better handling of X-Plane OpenAirspace comments.</li>
      <li>Disabling maximum airway segment length now for data sources that contain a valid airspace geometry
        (X-Plane and DFD - FSX/P3D contain invalid segments).</li>
    </ul>
