      New Options
    </b>
    <p>
      Tooltips in dialog <code>Options</code> give more help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that some options were moved around in the options dialog. These are also marked in the images.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Added scrolling and zooming ability to elevation profile. Elevation profile now has a context menu also
      including <code>Show on Map</code> and more functions.
        <br />
        Added splitter to elevation profile dock window which has sliders for zooming vertically and horizontally.
        These can be hidden by dragging the splitter to the right.
        <br />
        Zooming can also be done using mouse wheel (<code>Wheel+Shift</code> for vertical zooming).
        <br />
        Added keyboard navigation using cursor keys and numpad keys for zooming and scrolling.
        <br />
        Panning in elevation profile with mouse click and moving like in map. Double click zooms to position on map.
        <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a>
      </li>
      <li>Elevation profile now uses same aircraft icon as map. Changed elevation profile to completely adhere to map
      painting settings like line width, text size and symbol size. Profile display now hides flight plan if hidden on
      map. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/298">#298</a>
      </li>
      <li>Adjusted elevation profile to display passed, active, straight-in and circle-to-land flight plan legs in the
      same colors like the flight plan on the map. Navaid symbols are now on the descending or ascending line.
        <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/298">#298</a>
      </li>
      <li>Added option to display ILS and VASI slopes in elevation profile if an approach is selected. Menu items allow
      to disable these. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/299">#299</a>
      </li>
      <li>Added calculation and display for top of climb to elevation profile display. Calculation based on aircraft
      performance data.
      </li>
      <li>Now showing procedure altitude restrictions in profile display.
      </li>
      <li>Top of descent is calculated considering altitude restrictions of approach or STAR. Same for top of climb and
      SID. All legs after and at the FAF and FACF points are forced to minimum altitude to avoid arriving above ILS
      glideslope.
      </li>
      <li>Display of <code>Above Ground Altitude</code> on top label in profile window follows climb and descent slope
      instead of using cruise altitude.
      </li>
      <li>Giving clear error indication if cruise altitude is too high (i.e. TOC and TOC overlap) or if restrictions
      are violated due to too low cruise altitude.
      </li>
      <li>Removed barely visible highlight on map when hovering cursor above elevation profile. Highlight colors can
      now be customized in <code>little_navmap_mapstyle.ini</code>. Mouse position in elevation profile is now shown
      with a cyan/black circle on the map. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a>
      </li>
      <li>Jump back to aircraft functionality added in elevation profile. Uses the same settings as the map. <a href=
      "https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a>
      </li>
      <li>Fixed display color of profile labels for night mode. Removed all dark profile colors and pens from
      <code>little_navmap_mapstyle.ini</code>. Using OS and style colors now. <a href=
      "https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a>
      </li>
      <li>Solved problems where aircraft in elevation profile jumped to wrong leg or moved backwards.
      </li>
      <li>Aircraft track is now ignored when determining profile window altitude to avoid confusion when stale tracks
      result in wrong profile maximum.
      </li>
      <li>Aircraft direction now turned if reversal relative to active leg detected.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed issue where short lines were given wrong elevation with GLOBE data resulting in gaps in the elevation
      profile ground.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed several issues with aircraft movement and trail in elevation profile. Profile trail now depends on
      active leg and is now saved separately from aircraft trail on map.
      </li>
    </ul>

        This helps to avoid situations where the program zoomed too far out when flying with stale flight plans.
      </li>
      <li>Changed jump-back-to-aircraft logic to avoid weird behavior (zooming far out and other issues).
        <br />
        <strong>When aircraft is on ground or <code>Center map on aircraft and next flight plan waypoint</code> is not

      </li>
      <li>Start looking around on the map by moving first (mouse drag or cursor keys) and not by zooming (mouse wheel
      or plus and minus keys) to suppress aircraft centering for a while.
      </li>
      <li>Zooming without movement (drag or cursor keys only) keeps the zoom distance.
      </li>
      <li>Added option to avoid blurred online maps. This is enabled per default. See dialog <code>Options</code> on

      <li>ILS labels now adhere to the text background color setting for navaids. This allows to select a white
      background for the labels for better visibility.
      </li>
      <li>Now omitting curves, arcs, holds, procedure turns and other fancy geometry of procedures on high zoom factors
      to avoid a mess up of graphics in the spherical projection. Fixed flight plan leg distance label turning into

    <ul>
    <li>Added option to disable map window undocking in options dialog on tab <code>Map</code>.<br/>
        Allowing to undock the map window (option checked - default) can cause issues when resizing dock windows or the main window.<br/>
        Uncheck this option if you see strange or annoying resizing behavior when changing dock window or main window sizes.<br/>
        In some cases the dock window might also freeze, i.e. docks cannot be resized. Uncheck this option if you see one of these issues.</li>
    <li>Better URL test for weather and online URLs now also considering files.</li>
    <li>Improved check for valid whazzup file. Now looking for sections <code>!GENERAL</code> and <code>!CLIENTS</code>.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue with missing runway in X-Plane FMS files having circle-to-land approaches. X-Plane can now load these type of approaches without error message.</li>
    <li>Fixed wrong heading display for online aircraft in information display in some cases.</li>
    <li>Now centering destination and aircraft also for single airport plans (if flying a pattern).</li>
    <li>Fixed crash and/or freeze when saving flight plans with one leg or if TOC/TOD could not be calculated.</li>
    <li>Sped up zoom for maps <code>Plain</code> and <code>Simple</code>. More accurate display for zoom distance at lower levels.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue with ActiveSky showing old weather from stale <code>activeflightplanwx.txt</code> flight plan files. Now always using the latest from either <code>activeflightplanwx.txt</code> or <code>current_wx_snapshot.txt</code>.</li>
    <li>Fixed issue with wrong course display in traffic pattern in some cases.</li>
    <li>Com frequencies are now forced into 25 kHz raster on display.</li>
    <li>More minor GUI adjustments and fixes.</li>
    </ul>

    <b id="aircraft-performance">
      Aircraft Performance
    </b>
    <ul>
      <li>Aircraft performance edit dialog now has a fuel type (<code>Avgas</code> and <code>Jetfuel</code>) setting
      and converts fuel between weight and volume in input boxes when changing.
      </li>
      <li>Now always showing both volume and weight in aircraft performance report on tab <code>Aircraft</code>.
        <br />
        <strong>Avgas is the default fuel type. Change you present performance configurations to the correct fuel type
        to ensure proper weight volume conversion.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Flight plan table now shows both fuel weight and volume in separate columns.
      </li>
      <li>Performance collection now always uses weight and detects fuel type automatically from simulator. You can
      change from weight to volume in the edit dialog which will also do the conversion for you.
      </li>
      <li>Now showing red error messages on top of fuel report indicating invalid or missing values.
      </li>
      <li>Small text changes for performance report to make more clear that it is not updated during flight and used
      for fuel planning only.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- ====================================== -->
    <b id="online-networks">
      Online Networks
    </b>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed regression when reading whazzup files. This resulted in occasional crashes, wrong aircraft headings and
      other false indications.
      </li>
      <li>Limited excessive logging when reading whazzup files for online networks and added debug option for error
      reports when reading whazzup.
      </li>
      <li>Now omitting invalid QNH values from online center or client.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <b id="simulator-aircraft-and-flight-plan">
      Simulator Aircraft and Flight Plan
    </b>
    <ul>
      <li>The flight plan active leg is now suppressed if aircraft distance to nearest route leg is more than 50 NM.
      </li>
      <li>Centering of active flight plan leg and aircraft (if enabled in options) falls back to simple aircraft
      centering if distance to flight plan is larger than 50 NM. This helps to avoid situations where the program
      zoomed too far out.
      </li>
      <li>Changed jump-back-to-aircraft logic to avoid weird behavior (zooming far out and others).
        <strong>When aircraft is on ground or <code>Center map on aircraft and next flight plan waypoint</code> is not
        selected:
        Start looking around on the map by moving first (mouse drag or cursor keys) and not by zooming (mouse wheel or
        plus and minus keys) to suppress aircraft centering for a while.
        Zooming without movement (drag or cursor keys) keeps the zoom distance.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>Added saving of altitudes for X-Plane FMS formats which will show up for each waypoint in the stock FMS now.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- ====================================== -->
    <b id="elevation-profile">
      Elevation Profile
    </b>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed several issues with elevation profile and altitude restrictions as well as TOC and TOD calculation.
      </li>
      <li>Now forcing all legs after FAF and FACF to minimum altitude to avoid arriving above ILS glideslope.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed issue with circle-to-land approaches having too low MAP altitude. This resulted in a <code>Cannot
      comply to altitude restrictions</code> message.
      </li>
      <li>Made zoom sliders in profile less sensitive to mouse wheel by lowering page size.
      </li>
      <li>Display of <code>Above Ground Altitude</code> on top label in profile window now follows climb and descent
      slope instead of using cruise altitude.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed issue where short lines were given wrong elevation with GLOBE data resulting in gaps in the elevation
      profile ground.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!-- ====================================== -->
    <b id="procedures">
      Procedures
    </b>
    <ul>
      <li>Now adding last leg <code>Circle to Land</code> only if approach has no runway assigned. This avoids
      classifying too many approaches as circle-to-land.
      </li>
      <li>Adding new leg type <code>Straight In</code> for the last segment between MAP and runway now.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed drawing issues with missed approaches where first leg is of type <code>Intercept</code>. Missed
      approach now correctly starts at the missed approach point in these cases.
      </li>
      <li>The Maltese cross is now applied to either final approach fix or final approach course fix depending on ILS
      GS intercept altitude.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed regression where the last leg to runway was omitted for all approaches.
      </li>
      <li>Omitting altitude restriction now for waypoints on ILS GS. Instead showing <code>GS</code> indicator.
      </li>
      <li>Added workaround for 3-letter airport idents in procedures which were not recognized and showed an error in
      the procedure search (red procedure leg).
      </li>
      <li>Drawing problems with the turn to the first missed leg solved.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed issue with manual procedure legs before initial fix. This corrupted flight plans, altitude and distance
      calculation. Added new leg type <code>Vectors</code> for this.
      </li>
      <li>Now loading procedures partially from a flight plan if some could not be found.
      </li>
      <li>Better error report on procedure loading issues. No showing the procedure names which cannot be found in the
      database.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed lost procedure information after switching scenery databases.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <b id="map">
      Map
    </b>
    <ul>
      <li>Crab angle in compass rose now based on course to next waypoint instead of leg course. This is now consistent
      with the indicator showing course to the next waypoint of active flight plan leg.
      </li>
      <li>Now hiding details for airport patterns on higher zoom distances.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed wrong zooming that appeared when centering a flight plan which crossed the anti-meridian (near date
      line).
      </li>
      <li>Sun shading now correct.

    <ul>
      <li>Crab angle in aircraft progress now based on course to next waypoint instead of leg course.
      </li>
      <li>Moved options <code>Use a short name ICAO_ICAO.pln when saving FSX or P3D flight plans instead of the long
      name</code>, <code>Avoid overwriting Flight Plan with not matching departure and destination</code> and
      <code>Center flight plan on map after loading</code> to flight plan tab in options.
      </li>
      <li>User data type search is now properly reloaded for userpoints if the option for reloading saves is disabled.
      Always reloaded with <code>Airport</code> userpoint type before.
      </li>
      <li>Disabled tooltip effects (fading, sliding, etc.) since these do not work well with tooltip updates for
      weather.
      </li>
      <li>Now raising all floating windows on startup to avoid hidden and/or inaccessible windows.
      </li>

    <b id="elevation-profile">Elevation Profile</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Added scrolling and zooming ability to elevation profile. Elevation profile now has a context menu also including <code>show on map</code> and more functions. Added splitter to elevation profile dock window which has sliders for zooming vertically and horizontally. These can be hidden by dragging the splitter to the right. Zooming can also be done using mouse wheel (Wheel+Shift for vertical zooming). Added keyboard navigation using cursor keys and numpad keys for zooming and scrolling. Panning in elevation profile with mouse click and moving like in map. Double click zooms to position on map. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a></li>
    <li>Elevation profile now uses same aircraft icon as map. Changed elevation profile to completely adhere to map painting settings like line width, text size and symbol size. Profile display now hides flight plan if hidden on map. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/298">#298</a></li>
    <li>Adjusted elevation profile to display passed, active and circle-to-land flight plan legs in the same colors like the flight plan on the map. Navaid symbols are now on the descending or ascending line. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/298">#298</a></li>
    <li>Added option to display ILS and VASI in elevation profile if an approach is selected. Menu items allow to disable these. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/299">#299</a></li>
    <li>Added calculation and display for top of climb to elevation profile display.</li>
    <li>Now showing procedure altitude restrictions in profile display.</li>
    <li>Top of descent is now calculated considering altitude restrictions of approach or STAR. Same for top of climb and SID.</li>
    <li>Removed barely visible highlight on map when hovering cursor above elevation profile. Highlight colors can now be customized in <code>little_navmap_mapstyle.ini</code>. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a></li>
    <li>Jump back to aircraft functionality added in elevation profile. Uses the same settings as the map. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a></li>
    <li>Giving clear error indication if cruise altitude is too high (i.e. TOC and TOC overlap) or if restrictions are violated due to too low cruise altitude.</li>
    <li>Fixed display color of profile labels for night mode. Removed all dark profile colors and pens from <code>little_navmap_mapstyle.ini</code>. Using OS and style colors now. <a href="https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/34">#34</a></li>
    <li>Solved problems where aircraft in elevation profile jumped to wrong leg or moved backwards. Aircraft remains at destination now if moving past last route leg.</li>
    <li>Aircraft track is now ignored when determining profile altitude to avoid confusion when remaining tracks result in wrong profile maximum altitude.</li>
    </ul>
