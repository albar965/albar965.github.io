## Limitations

* Translations are not updated yet. The user interface will be a mix of your local language and
  English.
* The online and offline manuals are not updated yet. Neither the English nor the translated
  versions. Help buttons and links are functional but point to empty placeholder pages.

## Help
* Included map legend updated \([Map Legend Online](https://www.littlenavmap.org/manuals/littlenavmap/release/2.4/en/LEGEND.html)\).

## Installation

* You might have to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable on a fresh installation of
  Windows 10. Most will have this already installed since it is needed by many programs.
  You can get the Redistributable from the following download links:
    [MSVC 2015 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685) and [Downloads at LittleNavmap.org](https://www.littlenavmap.org/downloads/Windows%20Redistributable%20Packages/).
  **Install both 32 bit and 64 bit versions if needed.**
  **You can safely skip the installation if you get an error about a newer version already installed.**
* Reloading the scenery library is recommended.
* Reinstall the _Little Xpconnect_ X-Plane plugin to see bug fixes.
