## Notes

This update fixes several crashes when loading X-Plane scenery.

## Changes from Release 1.6.3 to 1.6.4

* Fixed crashes when reading X-Plane CIFP files with unknown approach type.
* Fixed crash with older X-Plane `apt.dat` files where runway name for VASI is missing.
* Fixed error where altitude restrictions were not recognized when given as flight levels.
* Enabled support for older `apt.dat` files with version down to 850.
* Added support for all altitude restriction types in procedures.
* Improved error reporting reading X-Plane dat files to avoid crash to desktop.
* Added error collection for X-Plane compiler. Now only stops reading the current file on error.
* Added workaround for P3D v4 add-on.xml files with inconsistent encoding.
* Fixed inconsistencies around context menus and procedure restriction display.
* Moved hidden URL to top in update notification dialog.
* Updated included PDF manual.
