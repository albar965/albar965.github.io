[![Little Navmap 1.4.3 Segment Calculation](/assets/images/littlenavmapcalcpartial_small.jpg)](/assets/images/littlenavmapcalcpartial.jpg)

_**Picture above:** Flight plan calculation between_ `EKVG` _and_ `BGGH`_. The space between Iceland and Greenland has no low altitude airways. Therefore the first segment_ `EKVG` _to_ `KEF` _and the last segment_ `DA` _to_ `BGGH` _can be calculated automatially while_ `KEF` _to_ `DA` _is a direct connection. See [here](https://albar965.gitbooks.io/little-navmap-user-manual/content/v/release/1.4/en/FLIGHTPLAN.html#calculate-for-selected-legs) for more information._
