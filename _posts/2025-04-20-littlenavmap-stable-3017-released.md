Thanks to everyone who reported issues!

## Changes from 3.0.16 to 3.0.17

* Fixed an issue where all VORTACs were loaded as TACAN in MSFS 2020, resulting in incorrect
  bearings and type display.
* Now omitting the channel for VOR, VORDME, and DME for all MSFS simulators. The channel applies
  only to VORTAC and TACAN.
* Fixed the issue with double runways when using the Navigraph navdata update in MSFS 2020.
  Example: The add-on for FHSH (no stock airport available) `kychungdotcom-airport-fhsh-sthelena`
  showed duplicate runways.
* Cleaned up error handling for the scenery library loader to allow loading to continue after an
  error in XML or JSON files.
* Fixed the issue where a broken CSV import resulted in errors for further imports of userpoints or
  logbook entries.
* More filtering has been implemented to eliminate incorrect MSFS aircraft indications before
  starting a flight in the simulator. The incorrect aircraft resulted in an aircraft trail crossing
  all over the world, causing display issues and crashes.
* Saving flown distance is now maintained between restarts. This avoids a zero flown distance in
  logbook entries.
* Now properly disabling context menu items in the logbook and user data search to avoid crashes.
* Added flown distance alongside flight plan distance to the bottom summary line in the logbook.
* Added an option to scale aircraft icons separately for web pages on high-resolution displays.
  This can be changed in the options on the `Web Server` page.
* Disabled the compass rose and other features on the `Dynamic Touch and Drag` web map.
* The compass rose, endurance, altitude range, and turn path are disabled to avoid a cluttered
  display when using the `Dynamic Touch and Drag` web map.
* Added a red extra range ring for zero fuel range. While the black dotted range ring shows the
  range with reserves, the red range ring shows the range without fuel.
* Clearing the procedure preview now occurs when adding a procedure from the map context menu. This
  is now consistent with the behavior when adding a procedure from the search tab.
* Improved circle drawing for range rings to avoid edges.
* Changes in command line handling: Opening flight plans using `-f` from the command line now
  leaves plans in an unchanged state to avoid question dialogs and ease automation. Passing a
  filename without an option might still change a plan on loading to adjust cruise and leave it
  changed.
* Plans created  from descriptions from the command line are not temporary and will be cleared on
  restart. Save the  plan manually to avoid this.
* Fixed issues where a changed flight plan was erased when loading from the command line or by
  double-clicking on the plan file.
* Enabled a warning when loading a plan with the wrong cruise altitude from a logbook entry.
* Fixed the blurry map issue when jumping back to the user aircraft after user interaction.
* Fixed issue where the map center was shifted with airspaces enabled. This placed the compass
  rose out of center at the right corner of the map.
* Added two options to disable distance and bearing display on top of the map tooltip. Change
  these in the options on the `Map Tooltips and Clicks` page.
* Attempt to fix crashes with long aircraft trails.
* Updated user manual for changes in command line and endurance.
* Updated Windows redistributable packages to the latest version.

**See the included `CHANGELOG.txt` or [here](https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/blob/v3.0.17/CHANGELOG.txt) online for a complete list across all versions.**

**All files are checked by [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com).**

**Note:** There are always a few false positives on the installer while the majority of 60 to 70 anti-virus see no issue. Download and unpack the Zip archive it if this scares you.
