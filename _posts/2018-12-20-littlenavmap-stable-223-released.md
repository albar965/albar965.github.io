## Notes

**This release contains bugfixes and updated translations of the manual.**

## Changes from Release 2.2.2 to 2.2.3

* Fixed crash when reading unexpected value in `activeflightplanwx.txt` of Active Sky.
* Fixed crash when doing `Show all` after `Select all` in search result table while using a spatial query.
* Problem solved where altitude restrictions in procedures caused an invalid `cannot comply to altitude restrictions` error.
* Fixed issue where flight plan airports or navaids were not detected in map context menu when display of airports or navaid was disabled.
* X-Plane `scenery_packs.ini` now read case insensitive to avoid errors.
* Fixed several display issues in elevation profile.
* Fixed drawing issues with altitude restrictions in procedures.
* Elevation profile showed wrong values for altitude on rightmost position in some cases.
* Little Xpconnect: `acf` file of user aircraft is now read for more attributes like identifying helicopters.
* Disabled display of flight plan position for airports and navaids in information window since it needs too many updates to function correctly.
* Full French and Spanish translated PDF user manual included. Online help is now complete for both languages.
* Updated French legend.
