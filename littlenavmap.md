## Version 2.0.2 Features

* *Little Navmap* is a **free** open source flight planner, navigation tool, moving map, airport
  search and airport information system.
* Supported platforms: **Windows 7/8/10, macOS \(10.10 or newer only\) and Linux \(64 bit only\)**.
* Support for **Flight Simulator X, Flight Simulator - Steam Edition, Prepar3D v2, v3, v4 and
  X-Plane 11 \(64 bit\)**.
* Comes with the following user interface languages: **Dutch, Brazilian Portuguese, French, Spanish and German**.
* All is based on flight simulator stock or add-on data, no third party data needed. All stock and
  add-on airports are loaded in a few minutes.
* **Navigation data can be updated from [Navigraph](http://www.navigraph.com/). A cycle 1801 database
  courtesy of navigraph is included in the download and includes navaids, airways, airspaces and procedures**.
* Navigation database updates by [fsAerodata](https://www.fsaerodata.com) and [FSX/P3D Navaids
  update](https://www.aero.sors.fr/navaids3.html) are supported. Support for X-Plane navdata updates
  and user defined waypoints.
* Can read airspaces in OpenAir format for X-Plane and FSX or Prepar3D airspaces can be copied into
  the X-Plane database.
* Uses X-Plane stock and updated navdata for approach, SID and STAR procedures including
  transitions.
* It features a detail rich **navigation map** that partially uses symbols from real VFR maps thus
  transporting a large amount of information. Multiple offline maps, online map themes
  ([OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), [OpenTopoMap](https://opentopomap.org),
  [OpenMapSurfer](http://korona.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/) and more) and two map projections are
  available. Several map themes provide hill shading.
* The map shows user and **AI aircraft as well as ships**, airports, **airport maps** (runway
  details, overrun areas, displaced thresholds, taxiways and more), VOR, VORTAC, TACAN, NDB, ILS,
  waypoints, airways, airspaces, approach and departure procedures and more. Plenty of information is
  available in tooltips or information windows for each map object.
* **Flight plans** and flight plan fragments can be loaded, saved and merged all using the common
  Flight Simulator PLN files as well as **X-Plane FMS format version 3 and 11**, FSC and FLP files.
* Flight plans can be exported to the **_Reality XP GNS 530W/430W V2_, the _Reality XP GTN 750/650 Touch_ and
  the _Flight1 GTN 650/750_**.
* More export formats are **GPX (GPS Exchange Format, including flown track), PMDG RTE, FLP, X-Plane
  FMS 3 and 11, Majestic Dash FPR and many more**. FS9 PLN can be imported.
* **Drag and drop** flight plan editing functionality on the map allows to easily create and edit
  plans.
* Several fast **automatic flight plan calculation** modes are available to create plans following
  airways or simply from radio navaid to radio navaid within a split second. No online service is
  needed for flight plan calculation.
* Option to **calculate flight plan fragments** between any two waypoints of a present flight plan.
* Flight plan route descriptions can be read which allows to convert flight plans from and to **ATS
  route descriptions** which can be retrieved from the various online services like
  [RouteFinder](http://rfinder.asalink.net) or [SkyVector](https://skyvector.com). This includes
  SIDs, STARs and information for cruise speed and altitude.
* A **profile** window shows the **ground elevation** along the flight plan including the minimum
  safe altitude for the whole plan or each segment.
* The map and flight plans including all related information at departure and destination can be
**printed**.
* A fast **airport and navaid search** allows to look for objects by an unimaginable amount of
  options also featuring a spatial search.
* **Information windows** display numerous details about airports, runways, COM frequencies,
  approach and departure procedures, navaids, the user aircraft, AI or multiplayer aircraft as well
  as ships, **decoded weather** from multiple sources like X-Plane, AS16, Active Sky Next, Active Sky
  for Prepare3D v4, NOAA, VATSIM and IVAO.
* The map display and the measurement units (nautical, metric, imperial) can be customized by the
  user.
* User interface and map display can be further customized by changing configuration files and SVG icons.
* All settings, search parameters, current flight plan, map positions and much more are saved
  between sessions.
* *Little Navmap* can connect directly to the flight simulator, the *Little Xpconnect* X-Plane
  plugin and can also be run stand-alone or in **networked configuration**.
* Complete functionality for **user defined waypoints**. Add, edit (also bulk-edit), delete, search, move and display.
  Allows to create custom categories and icons. Import and export of CSV, X-Plane and Garmin files.
* Optionally creates logbook entries in userdata for each takeoff and landing.
* **Can display IVAO, VATSIM and custom online networks centers and clients on map, tooltips and information windows.<br/>_IVAO is currently disabled due to missing clearance.
  Need volunteers to run a mirror._**
* **Compass rose** for map or user aircraft showing heading, track and distances.
* An **automatic reconnect** option makes the start order of programs irrelevant. Running a
  networked setup needs the included [Little Navconnect](littlenavconnect.html) program which eases
  setup across two or more computers.
* The program does not consume a lot of resources and can be run on **low end computers**.
* **Help** is available online \(can be downloaded as PDF, ePub or Mobi\). A PDF file with the
  complete manual is included with the program. Help buttons in dialogs link to corresponding online
  help chapter.
* The program can check for updates on three different channels \(stable, beta and develop\) and
  will show a notification if a new version is available. Configurable in options dialog.
