*Little Navmap* is a free open source flight planner, navigation tool, moving map, airport search and airport information system for Flight Simulator X and Prepar3D.

All is based purely on flight simulator stock or add-on data, no third party data needed. All stock and add-on airports are loaded in two to three minutes. Navigation database updates by [fsAerodata](https://www.fsaerodata.com) and [FSX/P3D Navaids update](https://www.aero.sors.fr/navaids3.html) are supported.

It features a detail rich navigation map that uses standard airport symbols from real VFR maps thus transporting a large amount of information. Multiple online and offline map themes ([OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), [OpenTopoMap](https://opentopomap.org), [OpenMapSurfer](http://korona.geog.uni-heidelberg.de/) and more) and two map projections are available as well as hill shading.

The moving map shows the user aircraft and AI or multiplayer aircraft as well as ships.

The map display and the units (nautical, metric, imperial) can be customized by the user.

Flight plans and flight plan fragments can be loaded, saved and merged all using the common Flight Simulator PLN files.

Additionally flight plans can be exported to the GFP format used by the Flight1 GTN 650/750.

Drag and drop editing functionality on the map allows to easily create and edit plans manually.
Several fast automatic flight plan calculation modes are available to create plans following airways or simply from radio navaid to radio navaid within a split second. No online service is needed for flight plan calculation.

Flight plan route descriptions can be read which allows to convert flight plans from and to ATS routes as can be retrieved from the various online services.

The map and flight plans including all related information at departure and destination can be printed.

A fast airport and navaid search allows to look for objects by an unimaginable amount of options also featuring a spatial search.

Information windows display numerous details about airports, runways, COM frequencies, approaches, navaids, the user aircraft, AI or multiplayer aircraft as well as ships, decoded weather from multiple sources like AS16, Active Sky Next, NOAA and Vatsim.

All settings, search parameters, flight plans, map positions and much more are saved between sessions.

Little Navmap can be run stand-alone or in networked configuration and can connect directly to the flight simulator.

An automatic reconnection option makes the start order of programs irrelevant. Running a networked setup needs the free *Little Navconnect* program which eases setup across two or more computers.
