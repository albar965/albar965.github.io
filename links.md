[**► Little Navmap EFB Client**](https://flightsim.to/file/85446/little-navmap-efb-client)

[**► Little Navmap VR Panel**](https://flightsim.to/file/43086/little-navmap-vr-panel)

This panel works differently than some other solutions which in majority just display a static image with a map view together with information in a form of a tables exactly as returned by Little Navmap. Here the map is constructed from the tiles and is displayed continuously so it can be zoomed and dragged. Data from the tables is extracted so it can be displayed and manipulated in any context, basically allowing me to an entirely different app on top of it.

[**► Mark Little Navmap airports as addons from the database of MSFS Addons Linker**](https://flightsim.to/file/88630/altolnm-mark-little-navmap-airports-as-addons-from-the-database-of-msfs-addons-linker)

Little Navmap is not able to mark the airport as an addon because the procedure of building the database of MSFS 2024 changed.

Therefore there is no indication in Little Navmap if an airport is an addon or not.

The utility uses the database of popular MSFS Addons Linker 2024 edition to read the airports and then mark them as addons in Little Navmap.
