      Other Simulators than FSX SP2
    </h3>

    <p>
      This program was compiled using plain FSX SP2 (no Acceleration) SimConnect version 10.0.61259.0.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might have to install an older version of SimConnect if you use <em>Prepar3D</em> or <em>FSX Steam
      Edition</em>. If not sure about this simply try <em>Little Navconnect</em> out. If it fails with an error message
      follow the instructions below:
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Prepar3D</em>: In the same directory as <code>Prepar3D.exe</code> is a <code>redist\Interface</code>
      directory (normally <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Lockheed Martin\Prepar3D v3\redist\Interface</code>). There are
      multiple legacy versions of SimConnect available. You have to install <code>FSX-SP2-XPACK.msi</code> for
      <em>Little Navconnect</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>FSX Steam Edition</em>: The installation adds the folder <code>C:\Program Files
      (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\FSX\SDK\Core Utilities Kit\SimConnect SDK\LegacyInterfaces</code> where you can find
      the legacy SimConnect interfaces.
    </p>

    <h2 id="h2general">
      General
    </h2>

    <p>
      <em>Little Navconnect</em> acts as an agent that connects <a href="https://albar965.github.io/littlenavmap.html"
      target="_blank">Little Navmap</a> with a flight simulator. This saves the pain of setting up a remote SimConnect
      link and allows using <em>Little Navmap</em> on Linux, Mac or older Windows XP computers.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="bold"><em>Little Navmap</em> cannot connect to the flight simulator directly. The <em>Little
      Navconnect</em> agent is always needed, even if all programs run on the same computer.</span>
    </p>

    <h2 id="h2usage">
      Usage
    </h2>

    <p>
      The setup and link procedure is the same for both remote connections and local connections. In the latter case
      all programs run on the same computer which is both flying and client computer.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Install <em>Little Navconnect</em> on the flying computer. Start it and take note of the message that is
      printed in the logging window. You only need the colored values. You can use the IP address or the hostname.
        <br />
        The program will automatically connect to the flight simulator using SimConnect, if found. If no simulator was
        found it will retry in 10 second intervals.
        <br />
        <em>Little Navconnect</em> can print multiple IP addresses or hostnames depending on your network
        configuration. This can happen if you have ethernet plugged in and are connected using wireless LAN too, for
        example. You have to try all addresses if you are unsure which one to use.
        <br />
        <code>localhost</code> and <code>127.0.0.1</code> will be used if you are not connected to a network.

          <span class="capthdg">Picture above:</span> <span class="capt"><em>Little Navconnect</em> is running and
          waiting for a flight simulator.</span>

          <span class="bold">Change the port in the <code>Options</code> dialog if you see an error message like shown
          below:</span>

</pre>
      </li>

      <li>Start <em>Little Navmap</em> on the client computer.
      </li>

      <li>Open the connection dialog in <em>Little Navmap</em> by selecting <code>Main Menu</code> -&gt;
      <code>Tools</code> -&gt; <code>Flight Simulator Connection</code>.

          the <em>Little Navconnect</em> shown above.</span>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>Add the value for hostname. This can be either the hostname or the IP address printed by <em>Little
      Navconnect</em>. You can use <code>localhost</code> if all programs are running on the same computer.
      </li>

      <li>Check the value for the port. <code>51968</code> is the default value and does not need to be changed
      usually.
      </li>

      <li>Click connect. The dialog will close and <em>Little Navmap</em> will try to establish a connection in the
      background which can take some time, depending on your network. Your aircraft will show up on the map and on the
      <code>Simulator Aircraft</code> dock window once a flight is set up and loaded on the simulator.
        <br />
        You will see the message <code>Connected. Waiting for update.</code> in the <code>Simulator Aircraft</code>
        dock window if no flight is loaded yet (i.e. the simulator still shows the opening screen).
        <br />
        <span class="bold">Note that it sometimes can take a while until an error is shown if you used the wrong values
        for hostname or port.</span>

      How to report a Bug
    </h2>

    <p>
      If something goes wrong send me <em>Little Navconnect</em>'s log file and configuration file which both can be
      located in the about dialog. My e-mail address is shown in the about dialog of <em>Little Navconnect</em> as
      well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please add all steps that are neccessary to reproduce the error.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="bold">If you're concerned about privacy when sending log files:</span>
      <br />
      The log files will contain all paths (like your <code>Documents</code> directory) which will also include your
      username as a part of the path. They might also contain your computer's name IP address in your network.
    </p>

    <p>
      In no case file names from anything else than flight simulator scenery or configuration files are included. No
      names or content of personal files is included in the log files.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'd suggest to remove this information if you're concerned about it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I strongly recommend to send the log files by PM or by email and not attach them to forum posts where they are
      publicly visible.
    </p>

      <span class="bold">Log files</span> of <em>Little Navconnect</em> for Windows 7/8/10 are typically stored in the

      <code>C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\AppData\Local\Temp</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      The program keeps three log files and rotates these on each startup. So you can find up to three logs:
    </p>

    <p>
