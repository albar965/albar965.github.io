      <span class="bold">Version 0.9.9.develop</span>
    </p>

    <h2>
      Installation
    </h2>

    <p>
      An installer or setup program is not available.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="bold">Do not extract the archive into the folder <code>c:\Program Files\</code> or <code>c:\Program
      Files (x86)\</code> since you will need administrative privileges in some Windows versions. Since Windows keeps
      control on these folders other problems might occur like replaced or deleted files.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Extract the Zip archive into a folder like <code>c:\Own Programs\Little Navconnect</code>. Then start the program
      by double-clicking <code>littlenavconnect.exe</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The zip archive contains a file <code>vcredist_x86.exe</code> which can be used to install the MSVC 2013 runtime
      distributable if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Little Navconnect</em> is a 32-bit application and was tested with Windows 7 64-bit and Windows 8.1 64-bit.
      Windows XP is not supported.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Other Simulators than FSX SP2
    </h3>

    <p>
      This program was compiled using plain FSX SP2 (no Acceleration) SimConnect version 10.0.61259.0.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might have to install an older version of SimConnect if you use <em>Prepar3D</em> or <em>FSX Steam
      Edition</em>. If not sure about this simply try <em>Little Navconnect</em> out. If it fails with an error message
      proceed as shown below.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the same directory as <code>Prepar3D.exe</code> is a <code>redist\Interface</code> directory (normally
      <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Lockheed Martin\Prepar3D v3\redist\Interface</code>). There are multiple legacy
      versions of SimConnect available. You have to install <code>FSX-SP2-XPACK.msi</code> for <em>Little
      Navconnect</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <em>FSX Steam Edition</em> installation adds the folder <code>C:\Program Files
      (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\FSX\SDK\Core Utilities Kit\SimConnect SDK\LegacyInterfaces</code> where you can find
      the legacy SimConnect interfaces.
    </p>

    <h2>
      General
    </h2>

    <p>
      <em>Little Navconnect</em> acts as an agent that connects <a href="https://albar965.github.io/littlenavmap.html"
      target="_blank">Little Navmap</a> with a flight simulator. This saves the pain of setting up a remote SimConnect
      link and allows using <em>Little Navmap</em> on Linux or Mac computers.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Usage
    </h2>

    <p>
      The setup procedure is the same if no remote connection is needed. In this case all programs run on the same
      computer which is both flying and client computer.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Install <em>Little Navconnect</em> on the flying computer. Start it and take note of the message that is
      printed on the logging window. You only need the colored values. You can use the IP address or the hostname.
        <br />
        <em>Little Navconnect</em> can print multiple IP addresses or hostnames depending on your network
        configuration. This can happen if you have ethernet plugged in and are connected using wireless LAN too, for
        example. You have to try if you are unsure which one to use.
        <br />
        <code>localhost</code> and <code>127.0.0.1</code> or similar will be used if you are not connected to a
        network. In this case you have to run <em>Little Navconnect</em> and <em>Little Navmap</em> on the same
        computer.
        <p>
          <img alt="Little Navconnect" title="Little Navconnect" src="images/littlenavconnect.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="capthdg">Picture above:</span> <span class="capt"><em>Little Navconnect</em> is running and
          waiting for a flight simulator.</span>
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="bold">Change the port in the <code>Options</code> dialog if you see an error message like shown
          below:</span>
        </p>

        <pre xml:space="preserve">
[2016-07-27 16:45:35] <span style="color: red;">Unable to start the server: The bound address is already in use.</span>
</pre>
      </li>

      <li>Start <em>Little Navmap</em> on the client computer.
      </li>

      <li>Open the connection dialog in <em>Little Navmap</em> by selecting <code>Main Menu</code> -&gt;
      <code>Tools</code> -&gt; <code>Connect to Simulator</code>.
        <p>
          <img alt="Little Navmap Connect Dialog" title="Little Navmap Connect Dialog" src="images/connect.png" />
        </p>

        <p>
          <span class="capthdg">Picture above:</span> <span class="capt">Connect dialog with correct values to access
          the <em>Little Navconnect</em> shown above.</span>
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>Add the value for hostname. This can be either the hostname printed by <em>Little Navconnect</em> or the IP
      address. You can use <code>localhost</code> if both programs are running on the same computer.
      </li>

      <li>Add the value for the port. <code>51968</code> is the default value. Usually this can be left unchanged.
      </li>

      <li>Click connect. Your aircraft will show up on the map and on the <code>Simulator Aircraft</code> dock window
      once a flight is set up and loaded on the simulator.
        <br />
        You will see the message <code>Connected. Waiting for update.</code> in the <code>Simulator Aircraft</code>
        dock window if no flight is loaded yet (i.e. the simulator still shows the opening screen).
        <br />
        Note that it sometimes can take a while until an error is shown if you used the wrong values.
      </li>
    </ol>
