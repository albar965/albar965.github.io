*Little Navconnect* is a free open source application that acts as an agent connecting *Little Navmap* with a flight simulator. This allows to use *Little Navmap* on remote, Linux or Mac computers and saves the the pain of setting up SimConnect links across a network.

## Links {#links}

**Little Navconnect is included in the download archive of [Little Navmap](littlenavmap.html).** Downloading it separately is normally not needed.
