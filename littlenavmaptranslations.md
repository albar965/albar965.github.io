# Status

Look at the Github issues below to see the status of the various translation packages:

* [Translate User Manual #136](https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/136)
* [Translate Program #135](https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/issues/135)

# Translation Packages

These are separate packages that add support for a language to a current _Little Navmap_ and _Little Navconnect_ version.

When a new _Little Navmap_ version is released all present translations are added to the new version and installing a package is not needed anymore. Simply check a new version after installing in a clean directory if it appears in your language. Install one of the packages below if not.

**Refer to the included `README.txt` file in the downloaded archive for installation instructions.**

**See [Translating](https://github.com/albar965/littlenavmap/wiki/Translating) in the _Little Navmap_ Wiki if you would like to contribute to Little Navmap and translate it to your language. All contributions are very welcome.**

## Compatible Versions

You can install translation packages in a not matching _Little Navmap_ version. The program will fall back to English if a text is not translated. As a result you will see the program partially in English and your language.

Different types of translation packages exist

* **Program Translations:** These modify only the program's graphical user interface. The included PDF manual and online manual are still English.
* **Manual Translations:** Translations of the online and/or the included PDF user manual. Install this to connect all help buttons in _Little Navmap_ to your language and get the PDF.
* **Full Translations:** Both of the above. Manual and graphical user interface appear in your language.
