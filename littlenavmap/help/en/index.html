      General Remarks
    </h2>

    <h3>
      User Interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      The user interface of <em>Little Navmap</em> consists of several dock windows that are arranged around the main
      window which contains the map view. The dock windows can be moved around in their docked position and can be
      detached from the main window by simply dragging them outside of the main window. All docks can be closed if they
      are not needed. You can even drop docks on each other to create a tabbed view (tabs will appear at the bottom of
      the dock stack in this case).
    </p>

    <p>
      Toolbars are also movable if you click on the left handle and can be closed or undocked from the main window too.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>
      Translation and Locale
    </h3>

    <p>
      <em>Little Navmap</em> is currently only available in English. I will happily support anybody who would like to
      translate the user interface into any other language. Despite using the English language in the user interface
      the locale settings of the operating system will be used. So e.g. on a German Windows you will see comma as a
      decimal separator instead of the English dot.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="bold">To avoid confusion: The screenshots in this manual were taken using German locale. This means
      that comma is used as a decimal separator and dot as a thousands separator.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Units cannot be changed currently and are adapted to aviation needs. So feet, nautical miles and knots are used.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Map Legend
    </h3>

    <p>
      The legend explaining all the map icons and the <code>Flight Plan Elevation Profile</code> is available in the
      <code>Information</code> dock window or <a href="legend.html">Little Navmap Legend</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Naming Conventions used in this Manual
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Empty airport:</span> An airport that has no taxiways, no parking spots or gates, no aprons
        and is not an add-on airport.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Add-on airport:</span> This is an airport that was found outside the Flight Simulator
        default scenery folder when loading the database.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Scenery Library Database:</span> This is an internal database (<a href=
        "http://sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>) that is created by <em>Little Navmap</em> by reading all the flight simulator
        BGL files. It allows fast searching and map display.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Navaid:</span> VOR, NDB or waypoint
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Rating:</span> Airports are given a zero to five star rating depending on facilities.
        Airports that have no rating are considered boring and will be displayed using a gray symbol below all other
        airports on the map. This behavior can be switched off in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Map
        Display</code> tab. The criteria below are used to calculate the rating. Each item gives on star:

          <li>Add-on
          </li>

          <li>Parking spots
          </li>

          <li>Taxiways
          </li>

          <li>Aprons
          </li>

          <li>Tower building (only if at least one of the other conditions is met).
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="h3troubleshoot">
      Troubleshoot
    </h3>

    <p>
      Delete the settings and the database files if the program crashes during start up. In Windows 7 these can be
      found in <code>c:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Appdata\Roaming\ABarthel</code>. Delete the file
      <code>little_navmap.ini</code> and the directory <code>little_navmap_db</code>.

    <h2 id="h2start">
      First Start
    </h2>

    <p>
      The <a href="#h2scenerylibdialog">Scenery Library Dialog</a> dialog will be shown when starting <em>Little
      Navmap</em> the first time. From there you can select all recognized Flight Simulators and load their scenery
      libraries into <em>Little Navmap</em>'s internal database. One database is kept for each simulator and can be
      changed on the fly in the <a href="#scenerylibrary">Scenery Library</a> menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      A warning dialog will be shown when starting <em>Little Navmap</em> the first time on a system without any flight
      simulator installations. See chapter <a href="#h2nosim">Running without Flight Simulator Installation</a> for
      more information on this.

      Menus and Toolbars
    </h2>

    <p>
      This chapter describes all the menu items of <em>Little Navmap</em>. You will find most of this functionality on
      the toolbars as well which are not be described separately. Key combinations can be seen on the menu items and
      are not listed separately in this manual.

    </p>

    <h3>
      File Menu
    </h3>

    <h4>
      Flight Plans
    </h4>

    <p>
      You can load, save or create new Flight Simulator PLN files. FS9 flight plan files are not supported.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Little Navmap</em> allows to create flight plans that unusable by the flight simulator. This can happen if a
      flight plan does not have an airport as departure or destination. A warning dialog will be shown when saving if
      this is the case. You can use these flight plan fragments in <em>Little Navmap</em> to merge and edit new plans.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using <code>Append Flight Plan</code> allows to load or merge complete flight plans or flight plan fragments into
      new ones. All waypoints are added at the end of the current flight plan. Then you can use the <code>Delete
      selected Legs</code> and <code>Move selected Legs up/down</code> menu items to arrange the waypoints and airports
      as you like.
    </p>

    <p>
      An opened flight plan file will be reloaded on start up (reload and centering can be switched off in the
      <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Startup</code> and <code>User Interface</code> tab).
    </p>

    <h4>
      Google Earth KML Files
    </h4>

    <p>
      You can add one or more Google Earth KML or KMZ files to the map display. All added KML or KMZ files will be
      reloaded on start up (reload and centering can be switched off in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the
      <code>Startup</code> and <code>User Interface</code> tab).
    </p>

    <p>
      All loaded KML files can be removed from the map with the menu item <code>Clear KML from Map</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Work Offline
    </h4>

    <p>
      Stops loading of map data from the internet. This affects the <em>OpenStreetMap</em> and <em>OpenTopoMap</em> map
      themes and the elevation data.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Flight Plan Menu
    </h3>

    <h4>
      Undo/Redo
    </h4>

    <p>
      Allows to undo and redo all flight plan changes.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Select a Start Position for Departure
    </h4>

    <p>
      A parking spot/gate/ramp/fuel box, runway or helipad can be selected as a start position at the departure
      airport. A parking position can also be selected in the map context menu item <a href="#fpdeparture">Set as
      Flight Plan Departure</a>. If no position is selected the longest primary runway end is selected automatically as
      start.
    </p>

      EDDN.</span>
    </p>

    <h4>
      Edit Flight Plan on Map
    </h4>

    <p>
      Switches flight plan drag and drop edit mode on the map on or off. See <a href="#fpedit">Flight Plan Editing</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Calculate Direct
    </h4>

    <p>
      Deletes all intermediate waypoints and connects departure and destination using a great circle line.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Calculate Radionav
    </h4>

    <p>
      Creates a flight plan that uses only VOR and NDB stations as waypoints and tries to ensure reception of at least
      one station along the whole flight plan. Note that VOR stations are preferred before NDB and DME stations are
      avoided if possible. Calculation will fail if not enough radio navaids can be found between departure and
      destination. Buid the flight plan manually if this is the case.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Calculate high Altitude
    </h4>

    <p>
      Uses Jet Airways to create a flight plan. The resulting minimum altitude is set into the flight plan altitude
      field. A simplified east/west rule is used to adjust the cruise altitude to odd/even values (this can be switched
      off in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Flight Plan</code> tab).
    </p>

    <p>
      The default behavior is to jump from the departure airport to the next waypoint of a suitable route and vice
      versa for the destination. This can be changed in <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Flight Plan</code> tab
      if VOR or NDB stations are preferred as transition points to airways.
    </p>

    <p>
      The airway network of Flight Simulator is not complete (the north Atlantic tracks are missing for example - these
      change daily), therefore calculation across large ocean areas will fail. Create the route manually as a
      workaround.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Calculate low Altitude
    </h4>

    <p>
      Uses Victor Airways to create a flight plan. Everything else is the same as in <code>Calculate high
      Altitude</code>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="calcfpalt">
      Calculate based on given Altitude
    </h4>

    <p>
      Use the value in the altitude field of the flight plan to find a flight plan along Victor and/or Jet airways.
      Calculation will fail if the altitude value is too low. Everything else is the same as in <code>Calculate high
      Altitude</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Reverse Flight Plan
    </h4>

    <p>
      Swaps departure and destination and reverses order of all intermediate waypoints. A default runway is assigned as
      the new departure start position.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Map Menu
    </h3>

    <h4>
      Goto Home
    </h4>

    <p>
      Goes to home area that was set using <a href="#mapsethome">Set Home</a> using the saved position and zoom
      distance.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Go to Center for Distance Search
    </h4>

    <p>
      Go to the center point used for distance searches. See <a href="#mapsetdistcenter">Set Center for Distance
      Search</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Center Flight Plan
    </h4>

    <p>
      Shows the whole flight plan on the map.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Center Aircraft
    </h4>

    <p>
      Zooms to the user aircraft if connected to a flight simulator using <a href=
      "https://albar965.github.io/littlenavconnect.html">Little Navconnect</a> and keeps the aircraft centered. The
      centering the aircraft can be changed in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Simulator Aircraft</code>
      tab.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Delete Aircraft Trail
    </h4>

    <p>
      Removes the user aircraft trail. It is also deleted when connecting to a flight simulator. The trail is saved and
      will be reloaded on program startup.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Map Position Back Forward
    </h4>

    <p>
      Jumps forward or backward in the map position history. The complete history is saved and restored when starting
      <em>Little Navmap</em>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      More/Default/Less Details
    </h4>

    <p>
      Increases or decreases details on the map. More details mean more airports, more navaids, more text information
      and bigger icons.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Projection
    </h4>

    <h5>
      Mercator
    </h5>

    <p>
      A flat projection that gives the most fluid movement sharpest map when using the <em>OpenStreetMap</em> and
      <em>OpenTopoMap</em> themes.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Spherical
    </h5>

    <p>
      Shows earth as a globe which is the most natural projection. Movement can stutter slightly when using the
      <em>OpenStreetMap</em> and <em>OpenTopoMap</em> themes. Use the <code>Simple</code> or <code>Plain</code> map
      themes to prevent this.

      Shows empty airports. This button or menu item might not be visible depending on settings in the
      <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Map Display</code> tab. The status of this button is combined with the
      other airport buttons. This means: You have to enable soft surfaced airport display and empty airports to see
      empty airports having only soft runways.
    </p>

    <p>
      An empty airport is defined as one which has neither parking nor taxiways nor aprons and is no add-on. These
      airports are treated differently in <em>Little Navmap</em> since they are the most boring of all default
      airports. Empty airports are drawn gray and behind all other airports on the map.

    <h4>
      Measure GC Distance from here
    </h4>

    <p>
      Starts a measurment line on the first click. Second click ends measuring and keeps the line. All measurement
      lines are saved and will be restored on next start up.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use the keyboard, mouse wheel or the map overlays to scroll and zoom while dragging a line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right click, pressing the escape key or any click outside of the map window cancels the measurment line editing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Measurement lines use nautical miles as unit. Feet will be added as unit if they are short enough so one can
      measure e.g. takeoff distance for crossing takeoffs and more around an airport.
    </p>

    <p>
      A great circle gives the shortest distance from point to point on earth but does not use a constant course. For
      that reason the measurement line will show two course values. One for the start and one for the end position.
    </p>

    <p>
      Course is indicated in degrees true. Additional information like ident or frequency will be added to the line if
      the measurement starts at a navaid or an airport.
    </p>

    <p>
      See the <a href="legend.html#mapmarks">Nav Map Legend</a> for details on measurement lines.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Measure Rhumb Distance from here
    </h4>

    <p>
      A rhumb line is a line of constant course and used between the waypoints of an airway or when approaching a VOR
      or NDB station. Distance between points is longer that the great circle route.
    </p>

    <p>
      The course for a rhumb line is normally indicated in degrees true. Course will be indicated in degrees magnetic
      if the measurement starts at a navaid or an airport that have magnetic variation. Additional information like
      ident and frequency will be added to the line in this case.
    </p>

    <h4>

    <p>
      Shows multiple red range rings around the clicked position. Number and distance of the range rings can be changed
      in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Map Display</code> tab. A label indicates the radius of each ring
      in nautical miles.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Show Navaid range
    </h4>

    <p>
      Shows a ring around the clicked radio navaid (VOR or NDB) indicating the navaid's range. A label shows ident and
      frequency and the ring color indicates the navaid type.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Remove Range Ring
    </h4>

    <p>
      Menu item is active if you right click is at the center point of a range ring. Removes the rings from the map.

    <p>
      This is active if the click is at an airport, an airport parking position or a fuel box. It will either replace
      the current flight plan departure or add a new departure if the flight plan is empty.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the clicked object is an airport the default runway will be used as starting position. The airport and parking
      position will replace both the current departure and start position if a parking position is clicked within an
      airport diagram.
    </p>

    <h4>

    <h3>
      General
    </h3>

    <p>
      Two search tabs are available for airport and navaid (VOR, NDB and waypoints) search.
    </p>

    <p>
      These tabs contain multiple rows of search filters that can be switched on and off with the drop down menu on the
      hamburger button on the top right.
    </p>

    <p>
      Filters are defined by various controls which are mostly self explaining. Only text filters and the tri state
      checkboxes like <code>Lighted</code>, <code>Approach</code> or <code>Closed</code> need a few extra remarks
      below.
    </p>

    <p>
      All filters can be used together where all conditions have to be met (<code>and</code> operator). Filters except
      the distance search filter are applied immediately. The distance search is applied after a short delay for each
      change.
    </p>

    <p>
      A tooltip on the blue question mark shows a quick help about searching.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Text filters
    </h4>

    <p>
      The standard is to search for entries that start with the entered text.
    </p>

    <p>
      The placeholder <code>*</code> stands for any text. Once a <code>*</code> is included in the term, the standard
      search (match start of text) is no longer used so you might have to add a <code>*</code> at the end of the search
      term too.
    </p>

    <p>
      The search is negated (find all entries that do not match) if the first character in a search box is a
      <code>-</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that all of the above does not apply to numeric fields like <code>Runways: Min</code> or <code>Altitude:
      Min</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Tri state checkboxes
    </h4>

    <p>
      These are used to filter airports by presence of certain facilities or properties.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Gray:</span> Condition is ignored.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Checked:</span> Condition must match.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Unchecked:</span> Condition must not match.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Colors and look of these checkboxes vary with theme and operation system. So instead of gray another color might
      be used (red fill on Linux or a <code>-</code> for Mac OS X).
    </p>

    <h4 id="h4distancesearch">

      Elevation processing is done in the background since data has to be downloaded and it is CPU intense. Therefore,
      the udpdate of the elevation display can take several seconds up to half a minute. This background update is
      started after creating or changing the flight plan and when new data arrives. The display will be updated
      accordingly whenever new data is available.

      You can follow these steps if you want to install <em>Little Navmap</em> on a computer not containing any flight
      simulator installation. No functionality is affected except scenery database loading which is simply not needed
      in this case.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is typically used when connecting to the flight simulator to watch the progress of a flight. Flight plans
      can be created, loaded and saved on the client computer. You only have to make sure that these are transfered to
      the flight simulator computer using Windows shares or by other means.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Install <em>Little Navmap</em> on both your flying computer and the client computer without simulator.
      </li>

      <li>Start it on the flying computer and generate the scenery library databases. See <a href=
      "#h2scenerylibdialog">Load Scenery Library Dialog</a> for more information.
      </li>

      <li>Select <code>Main Menu</code> -&gt; <code>Scenery Library</code> -&gt; <code>Show Database Files</code> on
      the flying computer. This will open the directory containing the database files in a file manager. You will find
      one or more database file like <code>little_navmap_fsx.sqlite</code> or <code>little_navmap_p3dv3.sqlite</code>.
      </li>

      <li>Start <em>Little Navmap</em> on the client computer and select <code>Scenery Library</code> -&gt; <code>Show
      Database Files</code>.
      </li>

      <li>Exit <em>Little Navmap</em> on the client computer.
      </li>

      <li>Copy the database files to your client computer using network shares, USB sticks or whatever you like. Move
      the files into the directory opened by <em>Little Navmap</em> before.
      </li>

      <li>Start <em>Little Navmap</em> on the client computer. The menu <code>Scenery Library</code> should contain an
      entry for each copied database file or no entry at all if only one file was copied. Airport icons should be
      visible on the map in either case.

      <code>Tools</code> -&gt; <code>Connect to Simulator</code>.

      </li>

      <li>Add the value for hostname. This can be either the hostname or the IP address printed by <em>Little
      Navconnect</em>. You can use <code>localhost</code> if all programs are running on the same computer.
      </li>

      <li>Check the value for the port. <code>51968</code> is the default value and does not need to be changed
      usually.
      </li>

      <li>Click connect. Once a flight is set up and loaded on the simulator your aircraft will show up on the map and
      the <code>Simulator Aircraft</code> dock window.

      Known Problems
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Some KML/KMZ files do not show up on the map.
      </li>

      <li>World coverage for elevation and <em>OpenStreetMap</em> hillshading data is not available for all countries
      and currently ends at 60 degree north. Also, artifacts can occur which I cannot influence (like in Italy south of
      the Alps). Use the <em>OpenTopoMap</em> which has a better coverage for hill shading and also displays elevation
      contour lines.
      </li>

      <li>Scrolling can be jerky when using <em>OpenStreetMap</em> or <em>OpenTopoMap</em> together with the spherical
      map projection. Either use the <code>Plain</code> or <code>Simple</code> map themes or use the
      <code>Mercator</code> projection.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>OpenStreetMap</em> or <em>OpenTopoMap</em> maps can end up fuzzy when using functionality like <code>Center
        Flight Plan</code> or <code>Go to Home</code>. Zoom once in and out using the mouse wheel to fix this.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>OpenTopoMap</em> has garbled names in some asian countries.
      </li>

      <li>Zoom can be too fast when using a touchpad with <em>OpenStreetMap</em> or <em>OpenTopoMap</em>. Use the
      <code>Plain</code> or <code>Simple</code> map themes, the overlay zoom buttons, the keyboard (<code>+</code> and
      <code>-</code>) or the map controls.
      </li>

      <li>The Marble floating map overlays on the map can be configured but do not save all settings.
      </li>

      <li>Flight plan and airways are drawn using great circle lines instead of rhumb lines. Distance and course are
      not affected by this.
      </li>

      <li>Support for Flight Simulator - Steam Edition, Prepar3D and Active Sky 16 is untested.
      </li>

      <li>Scenery.cfg files is not found automatically in Windows XP. Set the path manually as a workaround.
      </li>

      <li>Magnetic variance is partially not set (for example VORDME Cambridge Bay YCB). This is an error in the source
      data and should be fixed with a workaround when loading the database in the future.
      </li>

      <li>Mac OS X: Dock windows cannot be resized when undocked from main window.
      </li>

      <li>Mac OS X: Start position on the map is not saved. Use home as start position instead.
      </li>

      <li>Mac OS X: KML files are not centered after loading.
      </li>
    </ul>
