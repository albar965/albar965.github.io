      General Remarks
    </h2>

    <h3>
      User Interface
    </h3>

    <p>
      The user interface of <em>Little Navmap</em> consists of several <span class="bold">dock windows</span> that are
      arranged around the main window which contains the map view.
    </p>

    <p>
      The dock windows can be moved around in their docked position and can be detached from the main window by simply
      dragging them outside of the main window, by double clicking their title bar or clicking on the window symbol on
      the top left.
    </p>

    <p>
      Double click onto the dock window's title bar or click on the window symbol again to move the windows back into
      their docked position.
    </p>

    <p>
      All docks can be closed if they are not needed. You can even drop docks on each other to create a tabbed view
      (tabs will appear at the bottom of the dock stack in this case).
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="bold">Toolbars</span> are also movable if you click on the left handle and can be closed or undocked
      from the main window too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Use the <code>Main Menu</code> -&gt; <code>Window</code> menu to bring dock windows or toolbars back.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <span class="bold">main window title</span> indicates the currently selected flight simulator database (FSX,
      FSXSE, P3DV2 or P3DV3), the flight plan file name and a trailing <code>*</code> if the flight plan was changed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Almost all dialogs, text labels and all information windows in <em>Little Navmap</em> support <span class=
      "bold">copy and paste</span>. You can select the text using the mouse and then either use <code>Ctrl-C</code> or
      the context menu to copy it into the clipboard. The information windows even support copying of formatted text.
    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="images/all.jpg"><img style="width: 50%; height:auto" alt="Little Navmap" title="Little Navmap" src=
      "images/all.jpg" /></a>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="capthdg">Picture above (Click to see large version):</span> <span class="capt"><em>Little
      Navmap</em> with map and sourrounding docked windows. Currently selected simulator database is FSX, current
      changed flight plan is <code>IFR Les Eplatures (LSGC) to Dagali (ENDI).pln</code>.</span>
    </p>

    <h3>
      Translation and Locale
    </h3>

    <p>
      <em>Little Navmap</em> is currently only available in English. I will happily support anybody who would like to
      translate the user interface into any other language. Despite using the English language in the user interface
      the locale settings of the operating system will be used. So e.g. on a German Windows you will see comma as a
      decimal separator instead of the English dot.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="bold">To avoid confusion: The screenshots in this manual were taken using German locale. This means
      that comma is used as a decimal separator and dot as a thousands separator.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      Units cannot be changed currently and are adapted to aviation needs. So feet, nautical miles and knots are used.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Map Legend
    </h3>

    <p>
      The legend explains all the map icons and the <code>Flight Plan Elevation Profile</code> icons. It is available
      in the <code>Information</code> dock window or online: <a href="legend.html">Little Navmap Legend</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Naming Conventions used in this Manual
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>Highlighted text</code> is used to denote window, menu, button, file or directory names.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Empty airport:</span> An airport that has no taxiways, no parking positions or gates, no
        aprons and is not an add-on airport and is not a water airport.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Add-on airport:</span> This is an airport that was found outside the Flight Simulator
        default scenery folder when loading the database.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Scenery Library Database:</span> This is an internal database (<a href="http://sqlite.org"
        target="_blank">SQLite</a>) that is created by <em>Little Navmap</em> by reading all the flight simulator BGL
        files. It allows fast searching and map display.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Navaid:</span> VOR, NDB or waypoint
      </li>

      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Parking:</span> GA ramp, cargo ramp, fuel box or gate.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Rating:</span> Airports get a zero to five star rating depending on facilities. Airports
        that have no rating are considered boring and will be displayed using a gray symbol below all other airports on
        the map (<em>Empty Airport</em>). This behavior can be switched off in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the
        <code>Map Display</code> tab. The criteria below are used to calculate the rating. Each item gives one star:
        <ol>
          <li>Add-on
          </li>

          <li>Parking positions (ramp or gate)

    <h2 id="h2start">
      First Start
    </h2>

    <p>
      The <a href="#h2scenerylibdialog">Scenery Library Dialog</a> dialog will be shown when starting <em>Little
      Navmap</em> the first time. From there you can select all recognized Flight Simulators and load their scenery
      libraries into <em>Little Navmap</em>'s internal database. One database is kept for each simulator and can be
      changed on the fly in the <a href="#scenerylibrary">Scenery Library</a> menu.
    </p>

    <p>
      A warning dialog will be shown when starting <em>Little Navmap</em> the first time on a system without any flight
      simulator installations. See chapter <a href="#h2nosim">Running without Flight Simulator Installation</a> for
      more information on this.
    </p>

    <p>
      It can happen that the scenery library database has to be updated when you install a new version of <em>Little
      Navmap</em>. A question dialog will pop up and ask if the incompatible database can be erased. You can reload the
      scenery in the <a href="#h2scenerylibdialog">Scenery Library Dialog</a> after erasing the database.
    </p>
    <!-- ===================================================================== -->

    <p>
      This chapter describes all the menu items of <em>Little Navmap</em>. You will find most of this functionality on
      the toolbars as well which are not be described separately. Key combinations can be seen on the menu items and
      are not listed separately in this manual.

    <p>
      Opens a Flight Simulator PLN file. FS9 flight plan files are not supported.
    </p>

    <p>
      An opened flight plan file will be reloaded on start up (reload and centering can be switched off in the
      <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Startup</code> and <code>User Interface</code> tab).
    </p>

    <h4>
      <img class="textimg" alt="Append flight plan" title="Append flight plan" src="images/icons/fileappend.png" />
      Append Flight Plan
    </h4>

    <p>
      Adds departure, destination and all waypoints to the current flight plan.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using <code>Append Flight Plan</code> allows to load or merge complete flight plans or flight plan snippets into
      a new plan. All waypoints are added at the end of the current flight plan. Then you can use the <code>Delete
      selected Legs</code> and <code>Move selected Legs up/down</code> menu items to arrange the waypoints and airports
      as you like.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use these flight plan snippets in <em>Little Navmap</em> to merge and edit new plans.
    </p>

    <h4>

    <p>
      Saves the flight plan to a FSX PLN file (XML format).
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Little Navmap</em> allows to create flight plans that unusable by the flight simulator. This is the case if a
      flight plan does not have an airport as departure or destination. A warning dialog will be shown when saving if
      this is the case.
    </p>

    <p>
      A warning dialog will also show up if the departure airport has parking positions but no one is assigned to the
      flight plan.

      Calculate Direct
    </h4>

    <p>
      Deletes all intermediate waypoints and connects departure and destination using a great circle line.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can calculate a flight plan between any kind of waypoints, even user defined waypoints (right click on the
      map and select <code>Add Position to Flight plan</code> to create one). This allows to create snippets that can
      be merged into flight plans. You can use this if you want to cross the North Atlantic with varying destinations
      on both sides, for example. This applies to all flight plan calculation modes.
    </p>

    <h4>
      <img class="textimg" alt="Calculate Radionav" title="Calculate Radionav" src="images/icons/routeradio.png" />
      Calculate Radionav
    </h4>

    <p>
      Creates a flight plan that uses only VOR and NDB stations as waypoints and tries to ensure reception of at least
      one station along the whole flight plan. Note that VOR stations are preferred before NDB and DME stations are
      avoided if possible. Calculation will fail if not enough radio navaids can be found between departure and
      destination. Buid the flight plan manually if this is the case.
    </p>

    <p>
      This calculation can also be used to create a flight plan snipped between any kind of waypoint.
    </p>

    <h4>
      <img class="textimg" alt="Calculate high Altitude" title="Calculate high Altitude" src=
      "images/icons/routehigh.png" /> Calculate high Altitude
    </h4>

    <p>
      Uses Jet Airways to create a flight plan. The resulting minimum altitude is set into the flight plan altitude
      field. A simplified east/west rule is used to adjust the cruise altitude to odd/even values (this can be switched
      off in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Flight Plan</code> tab).
    </p>

    <p>
      The default behavior is to jump from the departure airport to the next waypoint of a suitable route and vice
      versa for the destination. This can be changed in <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Flight Plan</code> tab
      if VOR or NDB stations are preferred as transition points to airways.
    </p>

    <p>
      The airway network of Flight Simulator is not complete (the north Atlantic tracks are missing for example - these
      change daily), therefore calculation across large ocean areas will fail. Create the route manually as a
      workaround.
    </p>

    <p>
      This calculation can also be used to create a flight plan snipped between any kind of waypoint.
    </p>

    <h4>
      <img class="textimg" alt="Calculate low Altitude" title="Calculate low Altitude" src=
      "images/icons/routelow.png" /> Calculate low Altitude
    </h4>

    <p>
      Uses Victor Airways to create a flight plan. Everything else is the same as in <code>Calculate high
      Altitude</code>.
    </p>

    <h4 id="calcfpalt">
      <img class="textimg" alt="Calculate based on given Altitude" title="Calculate based on given Altitude" src=
      "images/icons/routealt.png" /> Calculate based on given Altitude
    </h4>

    <p>
      Use the value in the altitude field of the flight plan to find a flight plan along Victor and/or Jet airways.
      Calculation will fail if the altitude value is too low. Everything else is the same as in <code>Calculate high
      Altitude</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      <img class="textimg" alt="Reverse Flight Plan" title="Reverse Flight Plan" src="images/icons/routereverse.png" />
      Reverse Flight Plan
    </h4>

    <p>
      Swaps departure and destination and reverses order of all intermediate waypoints. A default runway is assigned as
      the new departure start position.

    </h5>

    <p>
      A flat projection that gives the most fluid movement and the sharpest map when using picture tile based online
      maps themes like <em>OpenStreetMap</em> or <em>OpenTopoMap</em>.
    </p>

    <h5>
      Spherical
    </h5>

    <p>
      Shows earth as a globe which is the most natural projection. Movement can stutter slightly when using the picture
      tile based online maps themes like <em>OpenStreetMap</em> or <em>OpenTopoMap</em>. Use the <code>Simple</code>,
      <code>Plain</code> or <code>Atlas</code> map themes to prevent this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Online maps can appear slightly blurred when using this projection. This is a result from converting the image
      tiles to the spherical display.

      other airport buttons. This means, for example: You have to enable soft surfaced airport display and empty
      airports to see empty airports having only soft runways.
    </p>

    <p>
      An empty airport is defined as one which has neither parking nor taxiways nor aprons and is no add-on. These
      airports are treated differently in <em>Little Navmap</em> since they are the most boring of all default
      airports. Empty airports are drawn gray and behind all other airports on the map.
    </p>

    <p>
      Airports having only water runways are excluded from this definition to avoid unintentional hiding.

    <p>
      Use click and drag to move the map and the mouse wheel to zoom in or out. You can also use the overlay buttons on
      the right side of the map.
    </p>

    <p>
      Alternatively use the cursor keys to scroll the map and <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> to zoom in and out.
      <code>Alt+Left</code> and <code>Alt+Right</code> goes forward or backward in the map position history. Do not
      forget to activate the map window by clicking into it before using any keys for movements.

    <h3>
      Mouse Clicks

    <p>
      A single click on an airport, navaid or an airway line shows details in the <code>Information</code> dock window.

    <p>
      A double click zooms in showing either the airport diagram or the navaid closely and also shows details in the
      <code>Information</code> dock window.

    <p>
      The double and single click functionality does not work for route waypoints or airports if the flight plan edit
      mode is enabled. The edit mode can be disabled using the toolbar or <code>Main Menu</code> -&gt; <code>Flight

    <p>
      Hovering the mouse over the map will show tooltips for all map objects like airports, VOR, NDB, airways, parking,
      fuel box and towers. The tooltip is truncated and shows a message <code>More...</code> if it gets too long. In
      that case reduce details or zoom in.

    </p>

    <p>
      These highlight rings provide all functionality of visible map objects, even if the objects are not visible at
      the current zoom level (ring is empty). That covers double click for zoom in, single click for information dock
      window and all context menu entries.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Airport Diagram
    </h3>

    <p>
      The display will change from a single icon to an airport diagram if you zoom in deep enough to an airport. The
      diagram shows all taxiways, parking positions, gates, runway and much more.
    </p>

    <p>
      The airport diagram provides more information through tooltips for parking and tower positions. A right click on
      a parking position allows to set this as a start position for a flight plan.

      Starts a measurment line on the first click. Second click ends measuring and keeps the line. All measurement
      lines are saved and will be restored on next start up.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can use the keyboard, mouse wheel or the map overlays to scroll and zoom while dragging a line.
    </p>

    <p>
      Right click, pressing the escape key or any click outside of the map window cancels the measurment line editing.
    </p>

    <p>
      Measurement lines use nautical miles as unit. Feet will be added as unit if they are short enough so one can
      measure e.g. takeoff distance for crossing takeoffs and more around an airport.
    </p>

    <p>
      A great circle gives the shortest distance from point to point on earth but does not use a constant course. For
      that reason the measurement line will show two course values. One for the start and one for the end position.
    </p>

    <p>
      Course is indicated in degrees true. Additional information like ident or frequency will be added to the line if
      the measurement starts at a navaid or an airport.
    </p>

    <p>
      See the <a href="legend.html#mapmarks">Nav Map Legend</a> for details on measurement lines.

    <p>
      A rhumb line is a line of constant course and used between the waypoints of an airway or when approaching a VOR
      or NDB station. Distance between points is longer that the great circle route.
    </p>

    <p>
      The course for a rhumb line is normally indicated in degrees true. Course will be indicated in degrees magnetic
      if the measurement starts at a navaid or an airport that have magnetic variation. Additional information like
      ident and frequency will be added to the line in this case.

    <h3>
      General
    </h3>

    <p>
      Two search tabs are available for airport and navaid (VOR, NDB and waypoints) search.
    </p>

    <p>
      These tabs contain multiple rows of search filters that can be switched on and off with the drop down menu on the
      hamburger button <img class="textimg" alt="Hamburger Button" title="Hamburger Button" src=
      "images/icons/menubutton.png" /> on the top right.
    </p>

    <p>
      The drop down menu prefixes menu items with a change indicator <code>*</code> to show that the related filters
      row has modifications. You can use this to find out why a search does not give the expected results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Filters are defined by various controls which are mostly self explaining. Only text filters and the tri state
      checkboxes like <code>Lighted</code>, <code>Approach</code> or <code>Closed</code> need a few extra remarks
      below.
    </p>

    <p>
      All filters can be used together where all conditions have to be met (<code>and</code> operator). Filters except
      the distance search filter are applied immediately. The distance search is applied after a short delay for each
      change.
    </p>

    <p>
      A tooltip on the blue question mark shows a quick help about searching.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Text filters
    </h4>

    <p>
      The standard is to search for entries that start with the entered text.
    </p>

    <p>
      The placeholder <code>*</code> stands for any text. Once a <code>*</code> is included in the term, the standard
      search (match start of text) is no longer used so you might have to add a <code>*</code> at the end of the search
      term too.
    </p>

    <p>
      The search is negated (find all entries that do not match) if the first character in a search box is a
      <code>-</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that all of the above does not apply to numeric fields like <code>Runways: Min</code> or <code>Altitude:
      Min</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Tri state checkboxes
    </h4>

    <p>
      These are used to filter airports by presence of certain facilities or properties.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Gray:</span> Condition is ignored.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Checked:</span> Condition must match.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Unchecked:</span> Condition must not match.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Colors and look of these checkboxes vary with theme and operation system. So instead of gray another color might
      be used (red fill on Linux or a <code>-</code> for macOS).
    </p>

    <h4 id="h4distancesearch">
      Distance search
    </h4>

    <p>
      This function allows you to combine all other search options with simple spatial search.
    </p>

    <p>
      The checkbox <code>Distance</code> has to be selected to enable this search. The result will include only
      airports or navaids that are within the given minimum and maximum range of nautical miles from the search center.
      This allows you to quickly search for a destination that is within the range of your aircraft and fulfills other
      criteria like having lighted runways and fuel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The center for the distance search is highlighted by a <img class="textimg" alt="Distance Search Symbol" title=
      "Distance Search Symbol" src="images/icons/distancemark.png" /> symbol.
    </p>

    <p>
      To restrict the search further you can select a direction (North, East, South and West).
    </p>

    <p>
      <span class="bold">Check the drop down menu for the change indicator <code>*</code> and the search fields
      for any remaining text if the distance search does not give any or unexpected results.</span>

    <p>
      The top shows a label that contains departure, departure position (parking, runway or helipad), destination,
      traveling time and flight plan type.
    </p>

    <p>
      Besides the label there are three input fields on top of this dock window:

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Speed (kts):</span> The value of this field is used only for calculating traveling times in
        the table view: <code>Leg Time</code> and <code>ETA</code> (estimated time of arrival at a waypoint given 0:00
        as start time). It is not saved with the flight plan and not used for simulator user aircraft calculations.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Cruise altitude (ft):</span> This value is saved with the flight plan and is also used to
        calculate an airway flight plan based on given altitude. See <a href="#calcfpalt">Calculate based on given

    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>Direct °M:</code> This is the rhumb line of constant course connecting two waypoints of a leg. Depending
        on route and distance it can differ significantly from the course of the great circle line. Use this course if
        you travel along airways or towards VOR or NDB stations. Opposed to the course shown by the Flight Simulator
        GPS unit this will give you the precise radial when approaching a VOR or NDB on a flight plan.
      </li>

      <li>
        <code>Course °M:</code> This is the start course of the great circle route connecting the two waypoints of the
        leg. Use this course if you travel long distances without navaids.

    <p>
      This dock window shows the ground elevation and flight plan cruise altitude together will all flight plan
      waypoints. It is only available when a flight plan is loaded. The user aircraft will be shown too if <em>Little
      Navmap</em> is connected to the simulator.
    </p>

    <p>
      Elevation processing is done in the background since data has to be downloaded and it is CPU intense. Therefore,
      the udpdate of the elevation display can take several seconds up to half a minute. This background update is
      started after creating or changing the flight plan or when new elevation data was downloaded. The display will be
      updated accordingly whenever new data is available.
    </p>

    <p>
      Close the <code>Flight Plan Elevation Profile</code> window if you think this causes performance problems. All
      updates will stop once the window is closed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be aware that the elevation display covers only the flight plan and will not change the depiction if you get off
      flight plan with your simulator aircraft. Also, aircraft climb is not shown (no aircraft profiles yet). The
      flight plan is only shown at cruise level.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the elevation data does not cover all countries and currently ends at 60 degrees north.

      Load Scenery Library Dialog
    </h2>

    <p>
      This dialog allows to load the scenery library data from all four supported flight simulators into the <em>Little
      Navmap</em> internal database. The dialog shows some information about the currently selected database
      (<code>Simulator:</code> drop down box) like number of loaded airports, database version and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can select the simulator in a drop down box which will show the base path and the <code>scenery.cfg</code> in
      two text edit fields. These fields are populated with automatically identified values first but you can change
      these to any other valid location. All values are saved for each flight simulator type.
    </p>

    <p>
      Loading a scenery library can take three to six minutes depending on your setup and amount of scenery add-ons.
      You can speed this up by excluding directories containing neither airport nor navigation data in the
      <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Scenery Library Database</code> tab.
    </p>

    <p>
      The previous scenery library database will be restored if you cancel the loading process or if the process fails.
    </p>

    <p>
      All airports that are not located in the default <code>scenery</code> directory are considered add-on airports
      and will be highlighted appropriately. Directories can be excluded from this behavior in the <code>Options</code>
      dialog on the <code>Scenery Library Database</code> tab.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program tries to find the base path and <code>Scenery.cfg</code> automatically. The typical locations of the
      <code>Scenery.cfg</code> are:

      Note that the number of airports, navaids and other objects shown in the <code>Load Scenery Library</code> might
      differ to the numbers shown in the progress dialog. This is the case since all found stock and add-on airports

    <p>
      You can follow these steps if you want to install <em>Little Navmap</em> on a computer not containing any flight

      in this case.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is typically used when connecting to the flight simulator to watch the progress of a flight. Flight plans
      can be created, loaded and saved on the client computer. You only have to make sure that these are transfered to
      the flight simulator computer using Windows shares or by other means.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Install <em>Little Navmap</em> on both your flying computer and the client computer without simulator.
      </li>

      <li>Start it on the flying computer and generate the scenery library databases. See <a href=
      "#h2scenerylibdialog">Load Scenery Library Dialog</a> for more information.
      </li>

      <li>Select <code>Main Menu</code> -&gt; <code>Scenery Library</code> -&gt; <code>Show Database Files</code> on
      the flying computer. This will open the directory containing the database files in a file manager. You will find
      one or more database file like <code>little_navmap_fsx.sqlite</code> or <code>little_navmap_p3dv3.sqlite</code>.
      </li>

      <li>Start <em>Little Navmap</em> on the client computer and select <code>Scenery Library</code> -&gt; <code>Show
      Database Files</code>.
      </li>

      <li>Exit <em>Little Navmap</em> on the client computer.
      </li>

      <li>Copy the database files to your client computer using network shares, USB sticks or whatever you like. Move
      the files into the directory opened by <em>Little Navmap</em> before.
      </li>

      <li>Start <em>Little Navmap</em> on the client computer. The menu <code>Scenery Library</code> should contain an
      entry for each copied database file or no entry at all if only one file was copied. Airport icons should be
      visible on the map in either case.

      logging window. You only need the colored values. You can use the IP address or the hostname.
        <br />
        <em>Little Navconnect</em> can print multiple IP addresses or hostnames depending on your network
        configuration. This can happen if you have ethernet plugged in and are connected using wireless LAN too, for
        example. You have to try if you are unsure which one to use.
        <br />
        <code>localhost</code> and <code>127.0.0.1</code> or similar will be used if you are not connected to a
        network. In this case you have to run <em>Little Navconnect</em> and <em>Little Navmap</em> on the same
        computer.

      Creating or adding Map Themes
    </h2>

    <p>
      To add an arbitrary online of offline map to <em>Little Navmap</em> simply add the map directory from a
      downloaded or self created map theme to the <code>data\maps\earth</code> directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The full path to the DGML file (see links below for more details about DGML) describing the map must be
      <code>c:\Own Programs\Little Navmap\data\maps\earth\opencyclemap\opencyclemap.dgml</code> if you like to add the
      <a href="http://www.opencyclemap.org" target="_blank">OpenCycleMap</a> for example. The DGML file can refer to an
      online map service or to included map data. Usually a map theme contains more files than only the DGML.
    </p>

    <p>
      The menu <code>Main Menu</code> -&gt; <code>Map</code> -&gt; <code>Theme</code> and the toolbar drop down box
      will receive an entry for each additional map theme.
    </p>

    <p>
      The options <code>Show Country and City Names</code> and <code>Show Hillshading</code> are enabled for all
      additional map themes but might not work depending on properties defined in the DGML file of the map.
    </p>

    <p>

    <h2 id="h2troubleshoot">
      Troubleshoot
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Delete the settings and the database files if the program crashes during start up. In Windows 7 these can be
      found in <code>c:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\Appdata\Roaming\ABarthel</code>. Delete the files
      <code>little_navmap.ini</code>, <code>little_navmap.track</code>, <code>little_navmap.history</code> and the
      directory <code>little_navmap_db</code>.
      </li>

      <li>Hiding the map screen overlays cannot be undone in the GUI. Restart <em>Little Navmap</em> to get the
      overlays back.
      </li>

      <li>The Marble overview map overlay on the top left of the map sometimes does not show a map background. Right
      click on it and select <code>Configure</code> to change this.
      </li>

      <li>You can exclude scenery directories in the <code>Options</code> dialog on the <code>Scenery Library
      Database</code> tab if loading of an add-on BGL fails. The path and name of the sceneries and filenames is shown
      in an error dialog after loading. Copy the directory part of the BGL file from the error dialog or find the
      directory containing the scenery and exclude it from loading in the <code>Options</code> dialog.
      </li>

      <li>Zoom can be too fast when using a touchpad with <em>OpenStreetMap</em>, <em>OpenTopoMap</em> or one of the
      other online map themes. Use the <code>Plain</code>, <code>Simple</code> or <code>Atlas</code> map themes or use
      the overlay zoom buttons, the keyboard (<code>+</code> and <code>-</code>) or the map controls.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>OpenStreetMap</em> or <em>OpenTopoMap</em> maps can end up blurred when using functionality like
        <code>Center Flight Plan</code> or <code>Go to Home</code>. Zoom once in and out using the mouse wheel, overlay
        zoom buttons or keyboard to fix this.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>OpenStreetMap</em> shows a dark gray background on some places without coverage (for example New Zealand).
        Use another map theme or switch off hill shading for the <em>OpenStreetMap</em>.
      </li>

      <li>Scrolling can be jerky when using <em>OpenStreetMap</em> or one of the other online map themes together with
      the spherical map projection. Either use the <code>Plain</code> or <code>Simple</code> map themes or use the
      <code>Mercator</code> projection. The same applies to a blurred map appearance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="h2knownproblems">
      Known Problems
    </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Some airport add-ons do not modify the stock airports but add new scenery and buildings. These add-ons will
      not be recognized as such and are therefore not highlighted on the map (italic and underlined text).
      </li>

      <li>Add-on developers have to use all kind of workarounds to avoid FSX' limitations. So the display and
      information given for add-on airports is not always correct. Typical examples are: Airports without runways,
      airports with runway dimensions 0 by 0 ft or 0 ft runway width, taxiways with 0 ft width, duplicate airports and
      more.
      </li>

      <li>Some KML/KMZ files do not show up on the map. Adding a centerpoint pushpin to the maps can fix this.
      </li>

      <li>World coverage for elevation and <em>OpenStreetMap</em> hill shading data is limited and currently ends at 60
      degree north. Use the <em>OpenTopoMap</em>, <em>OpenMapSurfer</em> or <em>Stamen Terrain</em> map themes which
      have world wide coverage for hill shading.
      </li>

      <li>There are errors in the elevation source data (like in northern Italy, Po Valley).
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>OpenTopoMap</em> has garbled names in some asian countries.
      </li>

      <li>The Marble floating map overlays on the map can be configured but do not save all settings.
      </li>

      <li>Flight plan and airways are drawn using great circle lines instead of rhumb lines. Distance and course are
      not affected by this.
      </li>

      <li>Magnetic variance is partially not set (for example VORDME Cambridge Bay YCB). This is an error in the source
      data and can be fixed with a workaround in the future.
      </li>

      <li>Airports are misplaced compared to the background maps. This is an error in the source data and cannot be
      fixed.
      </li>

      <li>Flight plan calculation along airways can result in unusable plans when using the <a href=
      "http://www.aero.sors.fr/navaids3.html" target="_blank">FSX/P3D Navaids update</a>s. Everything else should work
      as expected.
      </li>

      <li>macOS: Dock windows cannot be resized when undocked from main window.
      </li>

      <li>macOS: Start position on the map is not restored properly. Use home as start position instead.
      </li>

      <li>macOS: KML files are not centered after loading.
      </li>
    </ul>

      How to report a Bug
    </h2>

    <p>
      If something goes wrong send me any involved files (KML, BGL, PLN, etc., if copyright permits), <em>Little
      Navmap</em>'s log file and configuration file which can be located in the about dialog. My e-mail address is
      shown in the about dialog of <em>Little Navmap</em> as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please add all steps that are neccessary to reproduce the error.
    </p>

    <p>
      When an error occurs during loading of the scenery library send me the offending BGL file if possible. The full
      name and path of the file is shown on top of the error dialog if a specific BGL is the cause.
