    <h2>
      Features
    </h2>

    <h3>
      General
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Supported platforms: Windows XP/7/8/10, Linux, Mac OS X.
      </li>

      <li>Conservative user interface without experiments: Using a main menu, context menus, toolbars, dock windows,
      undo, recent file lists and more.
      </li>

      <li>Written using C++ and Qt - It is fast.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">The program saves almost all settings, like flight plan, windows positions, searches and
        more and restores everything on start up.</span>
      </li>

      <li>Most question or information dialogs can be disabled.
      </li>

      <li>Support for Flight Simulator X, Flight Simulator - Steam Edition, Prepar3D v2 and Prepar3D v3 (partially
      untested).
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Data is collected from flight simulator stock and add-on files. No need to buy or download
        external data like AIRAC cycles.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Weather display from ActiveSkyNext, NOAA or Vatsim in tooltips and information
        panels.</span>
      </li>

      <li>Scenery library databases for flight simulators are stored separately and can be changed on the fly.
      </li>

      <li>
        <em>Little Navmap</em> can be run on computers that do not contain any simulator installation at all. Just copy
        the scenery library database from your flight simulator computer.
      </li>

      <li>Airport and navaid icons are used throughout the whole program for easier recognition.
      </li>

      <li>Information panels show all about airports or navaids.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Exhaustive search function for airports and navaids that allows filtering by an unimaginable
        amount of criteria.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Distance based search for airports or navaids around a center point. Can be combined with
        all other search options.</span>
      </li>

      <li>Mac OS X and Linux versions in preparation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Flight Plan and Routing
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Can read and write FSX PLN format (XML).
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Drag and drop flight plan editing on the map.</span>
      </li>

      <li>Easy flight plan editing in the table view, like moving and deleting waypoints.
      </li>

      <li>Can merge flight plans or flight plan fragments.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Automatic routing (does not require online services) for high/low altitude airways, VOR/NDB
        and preset cruise altitude.</span>
      </li>

      <li>Routing is based entirely on flight simulator data. No third party data needed and not online services used.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Elevation profile display for flight plan. Shows minimum altitude for flight plan.</span>
      </li>

      <li>Undo/redo for all flight plan edits.
      </li>

      <li>Robust against malformed flight plans. Does not put unknown waypoints far off the route.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Map
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Uses two free online maps (<em>OpenStreetMap</em> and <em>OpenTopoMap</em>) as well as two simple offline
      maps. The offline maps are included.
      </li>

      <li>No need to download and install any additional elevation or map data.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Multiple map themes including hill shading and two map projections.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Airport display iconography based on real world VFR maps thus combining plenty of
        information in a small symbol and a few lines of text.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span class="bold">Detailed airport diagrams displayed in the map (not a separate window) including parking,
        taxiways, displaced thresholds, overrun areas and much more.</span>
      </li>

      <li>Add-on airport names are shown in italic text for easier recognition.
      </li>

      <li>Distance measurement lines and configurable range rings.
      </li>

      <li>Can load and display Google Earth KML files.
      </li>

      <li>History of map position and zoom distance like a web browser.
      </li>

      <li>Map display configuration including detail level on the toolbar.
      </li>

      <li>Symbol and text sizes configurable in options dialog.
      </li>

      <li>Detailed tooltips on map display
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Simulator aircraft
    </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold">Shows simulator user aircraft on the map including flight plan progress, ambient parameters
        like wind, temperature, pressure and more (similar to a flight management computer). Needs <em>Little
        Navconnect</em> which is free too.</span>
      </li>

      <li>Shows track of simulator user aircraft.
      </li>

      <li>Using <em>Little Navconnect</em> as an agent between the simulator and <em>Little Navmap</em> saves the pain
      of remote SimConnect setup.
      </li>
    </ul>
