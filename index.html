    </p>

    <p>
      <a href="littlenavmap.html"><span class="bold" style="font-size:1.5em;">Little Navmap</span></a> is a totally
      free open source flight planner, navigation tool, moving map, airport search and airport information system for
      Flight Simulator X and Prepar3D. It features a detail rich navigation map that uses standard airport symbols from
      real VFR maps thus transporting a large amount of information. Multiple online and offline map themes
      (OpenStreetMap, OpenTopoMap and more) and two map projections are available as well as hill shading.
    </p>

    <p>
      Flight plans and flight plan fragments can be loaded, saved and merged all using the common Flight Simulator PLN
      files. Drag and drop editing functionality on the map allows to easily create and edit plans manually. Several
      automatic flight plan calculation modes are available to create plans following airways or simply from radio
      navaid to radio navaid within a second or two. No online service is needed for flight plan calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      A fast airport and navaid search allows to look for objects by an unimaginable amount of options also featuring a
      spatial search.
    </p>

    <p>
      Information windows display numerous details about airports, runways, COM frequencies, approaches and navaids.
    </p>

    <p>
      All settings, search parameters, flight plans, map positions and much more are saved between sessions. So you
      know where you've been the last time when starting the program.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Little Navmap</em> can be run stand alone or in networked configuration. Connection to the flight simulator
      needs the free <em>Little Navconnect</em> program which eases network setup across two or more computers.

      tiny free open source application that acts as an agent connecting <em>Little Navmap</em> with a flight

      SimConnect links.
